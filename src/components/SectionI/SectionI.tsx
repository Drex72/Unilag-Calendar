                        The establishment of the University of Lagos in 1962 was informed by the need to intensify the training of a professional workforce for a newly independent Nigeria in search of rapid industrialization and economic development. It became evident after independence that the country lacked the requisite workforce to actualize the dream of national development and modernization. The popular belief then was that the goal of modernisation and industrialisation   mm can only be achieved through the establishment of more universities.

                    <p>
                        Towards this end, the Federal Government established the Eric Ashby Commission on Post-School Certificate and Higher Education in Nigeria in May 1959. The Commission's report, entitled Investment in Education, recommended the establishment of a new university in Lagos, the then Federal Capital, to offer day and evening courses in Commerce, Business Administration, Economics and Higher Management Studies. In 1961, the Federal Government assigned the detailed planning of the new university to a UNESCO Advisory Commission.

                    <p>
                        However, whereas the Ashby Commission had envisaged a non-residential institution to be sighted in the business district of Central Lagos, the UNESCO Commission opted for a traditional university, "a complete all-encompassing institution" with residential accommodation on a large campus. Following the acceptance of the UNESCO Commission's report, the University of Lagos was established on October 22nd, 1962 on the authority of the University of Lagos Act of 1962.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Act provided for an eleven-member Provisional Council for the University, a Senate to preside over academic affairs, and a separate Council for the Medical School located at the University Teaching Hospital at Idi-Araba, a few kilometres away from the main campus at Akoka.
                        This was rather unique for, by authority of the Act, the University consisted of two separate institutions: the main university and an autonomous Medical School. The link between the two institutions was tenuous, at best consisting of reciprocal representation on both Councils and membership of the University Senate by professors in the Medical School.

                        The University started with three faculties:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Commerce and Business Administration</li>
                            <li>Law</li>
                            <li>Medicine</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At its first meeting, the Board of the Faculty of Commerce and Business changed the name to Faculty of Business and Social Studies. The Faculties of Arts, Education, Engineering and Science were added in 1964.

                        For the first academic session, 1962/1963, the University admitted 46 students to the Faculty of Business Administration and 26 to the Faculty of Law. These students received their first lectures on October 22nd, 1962 at the temporary site in a secondary school at Idi-Araba, adjacent to the Medical School and the Teaching Hospital. Twenty eight medical students had already commenced lectures three weeks earlier on October 3rd, 1962. The University moved from its temporary location in Idi-Araba to the Akoka main campus in September 1965. The direction of the Universitys future development was consolidated with the promulgation of the University of Lagos Decree No. 3 of 1967. The new constitution created an integrated and more structurally coherent institution by establishing a single Council for the whole university. The previous arrangement had made provision for two separate Councils, one for the University and the other for the Medical School.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        With the new Act, the Medical School ceased to exist as a separate institution and became an integral part of the University of Lagos subject to the full authority of Senate. However, to ensure a measure of autonomy necessary for the smooth discharge of the responsibilities of some specialised units, the University adopted the collegiate system under which the Medical School became the College of Medicine. The Faculty of Business and Social Studies was divided into the School of Administration and the School of Social Studies. The Federal Advanced Teachers College was integrated into the university as the College of Education. The Institute of Computer Sciences and the Institute of Mass Communication were founded in 1967 and became teaching units a year later. The Institute of Child Health joined the University in 1969.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By the beginning of the 1970s, the University had developed an unwieldy and confusing academic structure in which the faculty system operated alongside the school and the collegiate systems. Law and Engineering were faculties; Education and Medicine were colleges, while Biological Sciences, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Environmental Design, Social Studies, Administration, Humanities, and African Studies were schools. On 28 June 1973, Senate finally adopted the faculty system for the whole University, conceding the collegiate system only to the College of Medicine. The re-designation of the College of Education required a constitutional amendment. Following the promulgation of the University of Lagos (Amendment) Decree, 1975, it also became the Faculty of Education. The previous unwieldy system was thus transformed into the following Faculties: Arts, Business Administration, Education, Environmental Design, Science and Social Sciences. The College of Medicine retained both its name and its autonomy.

                    <p>
                        The School of Postgraduate Studies, whose dramatic growth has attracted the sobriquet, the Lagoon Lighthouse, was established on 22 July 1981. In 1984, Federal University of Technology, Abeokuta (FUTAB) was merged with the University of Lagos, and was subsequently renamed the College of Science and Technology, Abeokuta (COSTAB). However, it was demerged from the University in January 1988 to become Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB).

                        The University of Lagos currently has a College of Medicine, School of Postgraduate Studies, a Distance Learning Institute (DLI) and twelve faculties, namely:
                        <ul>

                            <li>Arts</li>
                            <li>Basic Medical Sciences</li>
                            <li>Clinical Sciences</li>
                            <li>Dental Sciences</li>
                            <li>Education</li>
                            <li>Engineering</li>
                            <li>Environmental Sciences</li>
                            <li>Law</li>
                            <li>Management Sciences</li>
                            <li>Pharmacy</li>
                            <li>Science</li>
                            <li>Social Sciences</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The University has built a legacy of academic excellence and is now acclaimed publicly as the University of First Choice and the Nation's Pride. The University has recorded landmark achievements in various fields since its inception in 1962.

                        The first phase of infrastructural development at the main (Akoka) campus was completed in 1965. It consisted of two academic areas called Academic Group North and Academic Group South, the Dining Hall, Library, Administrative Block, the Central Concourse, staff quarters and students hostels.
                        The period between 1981 and 1991 may be described as a decade of economic leanness. The University seemed to have shared in the economic woes of the country as it helplessly watched many of its facilities fall into disrepair, and several employees leave its services for greener pastures elsewhere. There has been attempts to stem the tide of economic difficulties through the establishment of autonomous commercial outfits to boost the internally generated revenue, notably Unilag Consult and Unilag Enterprises (now Unilag Ventures)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Hydraulic Research Laboratory was also constructed with a grant from the Government of the Netherlands and a donation of N30,000.00 from the Nigerian Ports Authority. The University of Lagos International School was established in 1981 and moved to its permanent site in October 1985. The Senate House Complex was completed in 1984.
                        Between 1995 and 2000, the University took several measures to shed the cloak of financial dependency on the Government by extending the range of its revenue generation activities and securing the generous financial involvement of individuals in restoring and promoting the image of the University. The completion or inauguration of the underlisted projects clearly suggest the pace at which the University was moving towards economic self-sufficiency, a reflection no doubt of resourcefulness and remarkable statecraft:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Construction of two new hostels at the Faculty of Education - Biobaku Saburi Hall for male students and Madam Kofo Ademola Hall for female students;</li>
                            <li>Construction of a massive water reservoir near the Department of MassCommunication;</li>
                            <li>Construction of a number of boreholes in the service area of the Main Campus;</li>
                            <li>Construction of the first Junior Staff quarters, Phase 1, along Lawani Road, off University Road, Abule-Oja;</li>
                            <li>Painting of the Faculty of Arts Building and of the old Halls of residence both on the Main Campus and at the College of Medicine;</li>
                            <li>Construction of a walkway linking the Faculty of Science with the Faculty ofEngineering;</li>
                            <li>Construction of the Unilag Consult Complex</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 2000 and 2007, the University witnessed rapid transformation in terms of physical infrastructural development. This include extensions to the Faculty of Environmental Sciences; a new Faculty of Social Sciences Complex; new Hostel Blocks, renovation of old Hostels; a new Lecture Theatre donated by the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Chief Afe Babalola, SAN, LLD, CON; the new Post Graduate Hall donated by Dr. Erastus B. Akingbola; the new shopping mall on the Commercial Road; the rehabilitation of the erstwhile School of Radiography in Yaba to provide a campus for BA and FBA postgraduate programmes; the Drug Production of Unit of the Faculty of Pharmacy; the Laboratories for the School of Radiography; and a large (500 capacity) hostel for female students and  the Multipurpose Halls.

                        As an institution that has sought to remain relevant to its immediate environment, and to the country as a whole, because it is fully conscious of the socio-economic needs and realities of the nation, the University of Lagos has reviewed its structures and academic programmes on several occasions. The changes effected and the units affected are as outlined below:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Faculty of Pharmacy was created out of the College of Medicine in 1980. Also, the school of Radiography in Yaba was taken over by the University.</li>
                            <li>
                                The Department of Creative Arts was created in the Faculty of Arts in 1997. The Department was established to provide programmes in Music, Theatre Arts and Fine Arts leading to a B.A. Degree in Creative Arts. Its creation was tied to the phasing" out of the Centre for Cultural Studies and its activities, established in 1975, except those relating to auditoria management for which a committee will be responsible.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Department of African Languages and Literatures was renamed the Department of African and Asian Studies in 1997. The justification for the change of name was to reflect the incorporation of studies relevant to the cultures of African and Asian peoples. In 2005, the name of the Department was again changed to Department of Linguistic, African and Asian Studies.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Department of Modem European Languages was similarly first renamed Department of European Languages, but is now called Department of European Languages and Integration Studies.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The interdisciplinary collaboration which was implied in the School of Business and Social Studies between academic members of staff of the Departments of Business Administration and Economics but seemed to have ceased with the separation of the unit into two Faculties, resulted in the undesirable but consequential duplication of courses as reflected by FIN 411-Development Economics and BUS 427 - Industrial Economics. The problem was resolved in the decision that the Department of Economics should be responsible for the teaching of the two courses and other relevant courses after due consultations between the Faculties of Business Administration and Social Sciences.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In the Faculty of Education, the Institute of Education which was initially set up to collaborate with the Faculty of Education and was assigned specific functions by the Senate of the University in November 1979 was phased out with the academic staff appropriately reassigned to departments of the Faculty for greater efficiency;
                            </li>
                            <li>The Engineering Analysis Unit of the Faculty of Engineering was phased out and all members of the academic staff moved to departments in the University based on their academic backgrounds.
                            </li>
                            <li>In the Faculty of Environmental Sciences, the following changes were made:
                                Department of Geography and Planning was changed to the Department of Geography, a name it had when it was a Department in the Faculty of Arts before it was transferred to Environmental Sciences in 1986. Presently, it is a Department in the Faculty of Social Sciences, its course codes reflect the Social Science base. The Department of Urban and Regional Planning was also resuscitated.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Department of Architecture and Design is now known as the Department of Architecture. </li>
                            <li>
                                In the Faculty of Science, two new departments were created out of the Department of Biological Sciences, namely: the Department of Botany and Microbiology and the Department of Zoology, Marine Biology and Fisheries between 1997 and 2010.
                                The Correspondence and Open Studies Institute (COSIT) was renamed Distance Learning Institute (DLI) in 1997. It has since December 1997 become autonomous, thus terminating its formal relationship with the Faculties of Business Administration, Science and Education. Consequently, it can employ its own staff within or outside the University for its programmes.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Between 2010 and 2020, the University has further evolved and created several new developments some of which are highlighted below:
                        <p>
                            Change of Name

                                In 2020, the year of global lockdown because of COVID-19 pandemic, the University produced a low-cost Ambubag ventilator which was tested and patented as UNILAG/LASRIC-AmbuVent.
