                The history of the Faculty of Social sciences dates back to 1962 when the School of Business and Social Studies was established as one of the foundation-teaching units of the University of Lagos. Teaching commenced in the Faculty in the same year. In 1967, the School of Business and Social Studies was split into two namely: The School of Social Studies and the School of Business Administration. The School of Social Studies was subsequently renamed the Faculty of Social Sciences in October, 1973 with Professors T. M. Yesufu and late Obasanmi Olakanpo as  pioneer deans.
                </p>
                <p>The Faculty comprises seven Departments namely; Economics, Geography, Mass Communication, Political Science, Psychology, Social Work and Sociology. The Department of Mass Communication became a part of the Faculty in 1973 while the Department of Geography was removed from the Faculty of Environmental Sciences to become a Department in the Faculty of Social Sciences at the beginning of the 1997/98 Academic Session. Until 1986 when it was moved to the newly created Faculty of Environmental Sciences as the Department of Geography and Planning, the Department was based in the Faculty of Arts, running the B.A. Geography Programme and offering courses to B.Ed. Geography students. At the same time, the Department offered B.Sc. Geography programmes for science-based Geography students.   Approval was given by the University Council for the establishment of the Department of Social Work in 2017 although the B.Sc. Social Work programme had commenced in 2007 in the Department of Sociology. Social Work attained full departmental status in 2018, thus becoming the youngest Department in the Faculty.</p>

                <p className="mt-5">
The Faculty of Social Sciences is located on the Commercial Road, between the Works and Physical Planning Department and the International School.  The Faculty moved to its present location effectively from 16th January, 2007.  Before then, the Faculty of Social Sciences shared the same building with the Faculty of Arts in the Block adjacent to the Senate House. Some of its staff are still in the Faculty of Arts. The Faculty of Social Sciences has established a Research Laboratory equipped with computers to enable faculty and students undertake research activities efficiently.</p>


<p className="mt-5">The Faculty is committed to high research standards and encourages both staff and
students to pursue individual and/or group researches. The Faculty research committee
liaises with the University Central Research Committee to facilitate access of staff
researchers to grants. Students are required to conduct researches and submit acceptable
reports as part of their course requirements.</p>

<p className="mt-5">Members of the Faculty have been engaged in various researches and scholarly activities
over the years. They have continued to participate actively in national and international
academic conferences, seminars, workshops, and joint research projects with other
universities and research agencies. Faculty members have also continued to prove their
worth and relevance in academic and professional circles, and several members of the
Faculty have, at one time or another, served as consultants to various bodies including
government at the three levels (local, state and federal), government ministries and
parastatals, corporate bodies and financial institutions, and international agencies including 
the United Nations, UNICEF, The World Bank, UNDP, FAO, USAID, etc. A number of the
Faculty members have been appointed to serve as government commissioners, ministers 
and ambassador.</p>   

<p className="mt-5">The Faculty prioritizes training for early career academics to enhance their capacity and it organizes such trainings from time to time. In addition, it has, at various times, organized seminars, workshops and lectures on contemporary issues of national interest. Emanating from the workshops, conferences and seminars of the Faculty are scholarly publications including Perspectives on Nigeria Fledgling Fourth Republic. In response to the effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on Nigerians from the Social Science perspective, the Faculty published a       book The Social Impact of COVID-19 on Nigerians: Experiences, lessons and reflections in 2021.

                <TextHeading content='Economics Department' />
                <p className="mt-5">
The Department of Economics of the University is as old as the University itself. Since its establishment, the Department of Economics has benefited from the foundation and orientation laid for it through the fountain of knowledge of such erudite scholars as Professors T. M. Yesufu, O. Olakanpo, V. R. Diejomaoh, S. Tomori, F. O. Fajana, F. O. Olaloku, M. O. A. Adejugbe and Tayo Fakiyesi. Indeed, the Department currently boasts of accomplished scholars in various areas of specialization in the field of economics. The core competence in the Department encompasses economic theory, economic development, econometrics, international economics, industrial economics, financial economics, petroleum and energy economics, and transportation economics. 
Presently, the Department has five (5) research groups built around the following themes: Macroeconomic Policies, Stabilization and Growth (MPSG), Industrial Organization, Energy and National Resource Management (IOEN), Finance, Investment and Resource Mobilization (FIRM), Poverty, Income Distribution, Demography and Labour Market (PIDL), Trade, Regional Integration and Sectoral Policies (TRISP).</p>
<p className="mt-5">In addition, the Department currently runs the following programmes: B. Sc. Economics, Postgraduate Diploma in Economics, as well as M. Sc., M.Phil. and Ph.D. Given the array and quality of the academic staff and programmes of the Department, it is hoped that the Department will soon be transformed to a full-fledged School of Economics in line with the tradition of The London School of Economics, Norwegian School of Economics, and Ibadan School of Economics and Management. 
The Department of Economics has a computer laboratory with computers installed with software such as GAMS and E-VIEWS. The laboratory can also be used for teaching purposes. Computer laboratory is also open to Master and PhD students for training.</p>
<p className="mt-5">
The Department has a Journal named Journal of Economic Policy and Analysis (JEPA) which is a refereed and accredited scientific half-yearly publication. The Head of the Department, Professor W.A. Isola is the Editor-in-Chie, while Dr Taiwo Ojapinwa is the Managing Editor. The Department has a culture of organizing Public Lectures. In 2013, a Public Lecture titled Promoting Inclusive Growth in Nigeria: Issues of Policy Reforms, People Expectations and Private Sector Responses was organised by the Department as part of the activities to mark the 50th Anniversary of the University. The lecture was delivered by a renowned Scholar and Economist, Professor Akpan Hogan Ekpo on 13th of June, 2013. Since then, the Department has been holding annual public lecture. The last was titled The Nigerias National Rail Transport Project: Network, Financing, Challenges and the Way Forward Delivered by the Honourable Minister of Transportation himself, Rt Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi (CON) on Friday, 24th of September, 2021.

                <p className="mt-5">
Geography was one of the foundational disciplines of the Faculty of Arts. Geography in University of Lagos followed the pattern at the University of Ibadan and its progenitor, the University of London. Geography was administratively domiciled in the Faculty of Arts but the Department offered degree programmes in both Arts and Science Faculties i.e. B. A. in the Faculty of Arts and B. Sc. in the Faculty of Science. The crisis following a change of Vice-Chancellor in 1965 (in which five Deans were dismissed and the sixth resigned, along with mass resignation of staff) affected the Department adversely. Almost all the academic staff of the Geography Department left the University. The aggressive recruitment drive initiated by the new Vice Chancellor  Professor Saburi Biobaku - to ensure that academic programmes were not jeopardized saved the Department. A new lease of life was given to the Department (and the University generally) as academic activities resumed in October 1965. 
The new pioneers, including Dr. R. A. Akinola with able assistance of Dr. M. A. Abegunde, I. A. Adalemo and E. J. Usoro (with N.O. Alao, then a Graduate Assistant), jumpstarted the Department. The Department, up till 1986, was domiciled in the Faculty of Arts running the B.A. Geography Programme and at the same time offering B.Sc. Geography Programme for science-based geography students, as well as courses to B.Ed. Geography students. 
The Department grew steadily both in terms of staffing and course offerings and became recognized for its progressive treatment of the subject matter.  The academic staff complement which numbered 5 in 1965 grew to 12 in 1975 and has grown to about 28 (including Graduate Assistants) as at 2018/2019 session. The Department has twice adjusted and changed Faculty domiciliation, including the movement from the Faculty of Arts to the then newly created Faculty of Environmental Sciences, as the Department of Geography & Planning in 1986, and the movement from Faculty of Environmental Sciences to its current home, Faculty of Social Sciences in 1997 as the Department of Geography.</p> 
<p className="mt-5">
As of today, the Department of Geography in University of Lagos is vibrant and diverse with academic staff whose areas of teaching and research cover the whole spectrum of human geography, physical geography and human-environment systems which address pressing societal problems. These include: Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems, Environment and Natural Resource Management, Climatology and Climate Change, Biogeography, Hydrology and Water Resources Management, Cartography, Settlement and Human Habitat, Agricultural Geography and Food Security, Geomorphology and Paleogeography, Transportation and Logistics, Regional Planning and Development, Population Geography and Geodemographics, Medical Geography and Disease Ecology, Economic Geography and Regional Studies, as well as  Spatial Analytical Techniques.
Altogether, the Department runs six programmes at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. They are: B.SC. Geography, M.Sc. Geography, M.Phil./Ph.D. Geography; and the professional Masters in Geographic Information Systems (MGIS), Masters in Transport Planning and Management (MTP&M), and Masters in Disaster Management (MDM).

                <TextHeading content='Department of Mass Communication' />
                <p className="mt-5">The Department of Mass Communication, University of Lagos, was established in 1966 following a bilateral agreement between the Federal Government, the United Nations Development Programme, UNDP and United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It was established as an Institute of Mass Communication with its own Dean, Prof. S. Scotten. The great vision was that of serving as a center for training of journalists in the African sub region.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-5">Initially situated within the University's Library Complex, the Department was later moved to the Faculty of Arts. This accounts for the awards of Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degrees to its first set of graduates, including those students inherited from the war-ravaged Jackson School of Journalism at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka.
The Department, then an institute, awarded Professional Certificates and Diploma until 1968 when it started awarding degrees. When it became a Department, it still continued to use its Institute status to award specialized intensive diplomas to staff members of the media industries in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa.
</p>
                <p className="mt-5">The first Nigerian Head of Department of Mass Communication was Professor Alfred Opubor. Some of those who had served as Chairmen and Heads include Professors Ralph A Akinfeleye, Idowu Sobowale, Late Frank Ogbuajah, Nwuneli Onuorah, Andrew Moemeka, Drs. Adidi Uyo and Segun Odukomaiya. Others are: Professor Abigail Ogwezzy-Ndisikka, Dr Abayomi Daramola, Professor Oloruntola Sunday and the incumbent, Professor Adepoju Tejumaiye.
</p>
                <p className="mt-5">Prior to this development, a 1964 meeting of African broadcasters organized by UNESCO had recommended the establishment of an African Regional Radio and Television training Centre. In 1967, the Federal Government of Nigeria and UNESCO agreed that the proposed Center should form part of the University of Lagos, Institute of Mass Communication.  Consequently, a one-year Diploma programme, with the aim of providing a broad academic background and practical/professional training for middle-level media personnel was started.
Following a 1973 request for assistance, a UNDP/UNESCO technical co-operation project commenced in January 1973, with Mr. Richard Aspinall, the Resident UNDP/UNESCO expert, acting as Coordinator. The project involved the supply of equipment as well as visiting UNESCO experts in broadcasting and print journalism, who conducted staff training courses.
In February 1974, the Department of Mass Communication now integrated into the Faculty of Social Sciences, moved from its temporary location in the University's Main Library into the first phase of its building on a permanent site, where the Department stands today. This first phase of the Department is a one-storey building with state-of-the-art equipment. On its ground floor is a print shop photo laboratory. The floor above contains the radio broadcasting studio complex, which comprises two studios, one master control room and four gram-cup tape recording booths, all inter-connected. According to the original plan, the second phase of the Mass Communication Building (MCB) contained a television studio complex on the ground floor and offices for five professors and other lecturers on the floor above.  In pursuance of its mission and vision as center of media excellence in Africa, in the year 2002, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) granted a Radio License to the University to operate an FM Radio station named Radio Unilag 103.1FM. The Broadcast students of the Department received their practical work at the Radio Unilag 103.1FM. The Department plans to go back to its original status of a School/Faculty of Journalism/Mass Communication within the next few years.

<p className="mt-5">
<TextHeading content='Philosophy' />  
Conscious of the critical role of Mass Communication in society, the Department of Mass Communication has the major philosophy of producing high caliber graduate and post-graduate professionals who have the requisite knowledge and skills to occupy various positions in the mass media industry, media training institutions, public information agencies of both governmental and non-governmental agencies and the international media organizations.
The Department of Mass Communication seeks to provide training in communication skills needed in a variety of settings-interpersonal, group, organizational, cross-cultural, instructional, public and mass communication. The programme is designed to produce men and women who are professionally equipped in the area of communication. This is so vital because communication is the life blood of any healthy organization.</p>
<p className="mt-5">The Department is rated the foremost Mass Communication training institution not only in Nigeria, but also in Africa. It continues to strive to remain in the forefront for the media challenges of the millennium. Through its commitment to quality and professional proficiency, the Department wants to be globally acknowledged as the source of graduates who  will excel as professionals in the media industry and as teachers and researchers in mass communication. Besides, the Department's vision is to remain as a Center of Excellence in mass communication research and training; a place for imparting and generating knowledge about the mass media and their audiences through research. It seeks therefore to become an indispensable port of call for academics and media organizations seeking information about the performance of media professions and the behaviour of media audiences in Nigeria and the continuous training and re-training of the members of the Fourth Estate of the Realm.</p>
<p className="mt-5">The Department ,among other things, takes pride in being the trainer of more than 90% (ninety percent) of Editors of the major Newspapers/Magazines, Broadcast Radio/TV, Public Relations and Advertising Agencies in Nigeria.</p>
<p className="mt-5">The Department is very proud to be the first and only Department of Mass Communication in Africa, to produce in 2005 Africa's first winner of the prestigious Pulitzer Prize in Journalism, Mr. Dele Olojede, one of the Department's graduates, who won this esteemed award. The Pulitzer Prize in Journalism is the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>
<p className="mt-5">The Department also takes the pride as the first Department to be granted license to operate a campus radio station Radio Unilag 103.1 FM.</p>

                <TextHeading content='Department of Political Science' />
                <p className="mt-5">The Department of Political Science of University of Lagos started as a Unit of the Schools of Business and Social Studies in 1962, the year the University of Lagos was established. The Unit offered courses which were integrated into the parent School of Business and Social Studies. In 1966, the Unit acquired a departmental status within the School of Business and Social Studies before the establishment of the Faculty of Social Sciences in the 1967/68 academic session. </p>
                <p className="mt-5">With the establishment of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Political Science became a department offering a full-fledged undergraduate programme leading to the award of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Political Science after four years. In 1970, the Department began a Postgraduate degree programme, Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Political Science. In the 1978/79 academic session, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree was introduced, and in 1980/81, the Department commenced the Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree programmes. As the demand for intellectual and manpower needs of the country increased, another postgraduate programme known as Master of Public and International Affairs (M.P.I.A.) was introduced by the Faculty in conjunction with other departments. Master of International Relations (MISS) was introduced in the 2012/2013 session, with another postgraduate programme, Master of Research and Public Policy (MRPP) introduced in the 2013/2014 session. B.Sc. Public Administration (Full Time) has been approved by the Senate and will commence in September/October 2022.  </p>
                <p className="mt-5">The Department had the late Professor Eme O. Awa as its pioneering Head of Department, succeeded by a number of distinguished academics including late Professor Babs Williams, late Professor Opeyemi Ola, Professor Adele Jinadu, late Professor Oyeleye Oyediran, Professor John Amoda, late Professor Stephen Olugbemi, Professor Alaba Ogunsanwo, Professor Remi Anifowose, Professor Kayode Soremekun, Professor Solomon Akinboye, Professor Browne Onuoha, Dr. Adelaja Odukoya, and the current head, Professor Derin Ologbenla.

The Department publishes the Unilag Journal of Politics with Professor Derin Ologbenla as the Editor-in-Chief and Dr. Godwin Okeke as the current Managing Editor.</p>
                <p className="mt-5">
The philosophy of the Department is derived from the overall philosophy of the University, which is to be a top-class institution for the pursuit of excellence in knowledge, character and service to humanity. In pursuance of this, the Department is driven by the goal to educate students to develop critical consciousness and skills to describe, explain and predict the use of power and its dynamics at micro, meso and macro levels of the society. </p>
<TextHeading content='Objectives of THE Department' />   
<p className="mt-5">In specific terms, the objectives of the Department are:</p>
<p className="mt-5">To be the foremost Department in teaching and research in Political Science locally and internationally.</p>
<p className="mt-5">To provide qualitative education and training to Nigerian youths in the field of Political Science.</p>
<p className="mt-5">To excel in research and contribute to the manpower needs of the nation.</p>
<p className="mt-5">To be a pivot upon which the intellectual, social, economic and political development of our nation revolves.</p>
<p className="mt-5">As one of the first generation universities, the University of Lagos has an obligation to the Nigerian society to produce through its teaching, research and other contributions,  world class leadership and nation builders. One of the key disciplines towards accomplishing that responsibility is through the teachings of Political Science. The discipline of Political Science offers some of the requisite courses for nation building. It also produces leadership cadre very critical to national development. The Department is committed to high research standards and encourages both staff and students to pursue cutting-edge individual and/or group researches. The Departmental Research Committee liaises with the University Central Research Committee, through the Faculty Research Committee, to facilitate access of staff researchers to grants. Students are required to conduct researches and submit acceptable reports as part of their course requirements.</p>
<p className="mt-5">Members of the Department have been engaged in various researches and scholarly activities over the years. They continue to participate actively in national and international academic conferences, seminars, workshops, and collaborative research projects with researchers and colleagues in other universities and research agencies. Furthermore, members have also continued to prove their worth and relevance in academic and professional circles. Over the years, members of staff have served as consultants to various bodies, including Government at the three levels (Local, State and Federal), corporate bodies and financial institutions, and international agencies, including the United Nations, UNICEF, The World Bank, UNDP, FAG, USAID, e.t.c. A number of the academic staff have been appointed to serve as Commissioners, Ministers and Ambassadors.</p>
<p className="mt-5">From time to time, the Department organizes seminars, workshops, lectures and conferences on contemporary issues of national interest. For instance, the Department is the first department of Political Science in the country to organize an international conference to commemorate fifty years of Nigeria's independence. A book, containing peer-reviewed papers presented at the conference, has been published. The Department, in 2016, organized a national symposium with the theme of X-raying 50 years of Military Intervention in Nigerias Politics. </p>

                <TextHeading content='Department of Psychology' />
                <p className="mt-5">What is today known as the Department of Psychology, University of Lagos, started in 1965 when psychology was restricted to a one-term course in School of Social Studies and Business Administration.  Afterwards it was taught as a science subject in the prelim class alone to seven students by Late Mr. E. T. Abiola in his office in 1965/66 session. Lectures were mainly on theoretical discussion and practical exercises in Psychology. The former Nigeria Minister of Steel Development, Mr. Paul Unongo was the 2nd lecturer ever to be employed in the Department in 1966/67 session.  He was then lecturing experimental psychology and by this period psychology had become a subject in year one science.  Psychology became a Department in University of Lagos in the 1969/70 session with General, Experimental, Practical Psychology, Human Biology, Remedial Maths, Economics and Elements of Social Relations as subjects. Then, the Acting Head of Department was Mr. E.T.  Abiola, with Mr. Unongo and Dr. Franklin as members of staff.</p>
                <p className="mt-5">A drastic change occurred in 1970 with the appointment of Prof. A. C. Mundy-Castle as the new H.O.D. while the  staff strength rose to six.  A major set-back soon hit the Department when Mr. P. Unongo went on study leave, Dr. Franklin returned to U.S.A., and Mr. Abiola resigned and went to London but died few months later.  However, in 1971/72, Mrs. S. Odiase and Mrs. I. Fatimilehin-two female lecturers joined the Department.  In 1972, Prof. Mundy-Castle was invited as external examiner in psychology at the University of Zambia, Lusaka.  There he met an internationally reputable lecturer in psychology, Dr. M. O. Okonji who later became a Senior Lecturer at the Department in 1973, a time when the teaching staff strength increased by three.  And in 1974, it also increased when Dr. G. A. Sote (who later became a professor in the department before his retirement) joined the academic staff.  </p>
                <p className="mt-5">The Department produced her first graduates in 1971/72 session. Out of the 15 students that were awarded B.Sc., one of them, Miss. Onibuwe Johnson bagged a First Class honours.  Such a feat re-occurred in 1974 and 1976 with Miss. Funmi Olagbaiye (Late Dr. Funmi Olagbaiye) and Miss. Agiobu Kemmer (now a Professor in the Department) respectively graduating with First class honours.  Both eventually obtained the doctorate degree and became lecturers in the Department.</p>
                <p className="mt-5">In 1977/78 session, the M.Sc. programme was introduced.  It was a two-year programme then. Following the introduction the M.Phil./Ph.D programme, the M.Sc. programme was reduced to one year. </p>
                <p className="mt-5">Presently there are over 17 lecturers in the Department who are doctorate degree holders. Many of them are products of the Department.</p>

This was shortly after after the inception of the Department. The first coordinator was Dr. S. A. Adebagbo, a product of Manchester University,United Kingdom.</p>
                <p className="mt-5">He was assisted by predominantly American-trained Social Work educators such asD r.G.Jinadu, Dr.M.W.Karanja,MissO.PBoyoandMr.JamesEghaghe,etc.The B.Sc. Social Work programme was not established until 2007, 38years after SDA was established. The Social Work Unit was created by the University in 2014 but was still operating under the administrative structure of Sociology Department. In December 2017, the University of Lagos Council approved the establishment of the Department of Social Work.

                <p className="mt-5">The Department conventionally holds an Annual Distinguished Public Lecture and National Conference or both.  The primary objective of the Lecture is to stimulate intellectual discourse focusing on a subject of global interest with implications for national development. In 2021, the theme for the National Conference was Nigerias Data Challenge. The Department also organized a colloquium on Perspectives on the Development Crisis in Nigeria in the same year. It was an occasion for panelists to interrogate and point the way out of Nigerias Development crisis.</p>
                <p className="mt-5">In 2021, the Department also hosted Dr Ifeoma Okoye, a Fulbright Scholar from the Department of Criminal Justice, Virginia State University (VSU). Her visit attracted an endowment prize for the best graduating student in Criminology in the Department.</p>
                <p className="mt-5">The Department has also succeeded in establishing a strong Diaspora Alumni body which has become a source of support to her. This is in addition to the establishment of the National Alumni body of the Department.  As part of her future plans, the Department hopes to interface with the private sector on the possibility of securing internship placements for her students, for practical hand-on experience before they graduate. </p>
