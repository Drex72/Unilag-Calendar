Postgraduate Studies began informally in various departments at the University of Lagos in the 1966/1967 academic session. In July, 1981, a School of Postgraduate Studies was established by Senate to coordinate and develop research studies through a formalised university-wide programme.

In pursuance of this mandate, the School has trained thousands of staff for Nigerian industries and private establishments, Universities in Nigeria and abroad, Nigeria's National Universities Commission, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education, the Armed Forces, Federal and State Government establishments as well as international agencies.
