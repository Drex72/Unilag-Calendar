                        In the period 1978 to 1982, the Housing Allocation Committee was a non-statutory body responsible to the Vice Chancellor.  It supplemented the Universitys decisions as regards the acquisition and allocation of houses to members of staff.  At the same time, there were other departments or units available to the Vice Chancellor for making and/or implementing decisions relating to housing, namely the Registry with special reference to staff welfare, the Bursary with special reference to funds and finance and Works and Services Unit with special reference to maintenance issues.

                    <p>However, by 1981 the Committee and the staff had started to experience some difficulties in housing matters.  As a result, the Committee submitted a report in May 1982 on the review of its policies and operations to ensure optimum performance.  Consequently, the Development Committee reviewed the terms of reference and the organizational structure of the Committee.  The review brought about a change in the name of the Housing Allocation Committee to 'Housing Committee' and the creation of the Housing Unit.  The Housing Committee was, therefore, left with the formulation of broad policy guidelines under a chairman who also administers the Housing Unit.

                        The vision and mission of the University for housing from its inception have been provision of homes for all its staff in order to enhance their job performance.  Lagos, being a metropolitan city is laden with scarcity of accommodation which has resulted to high cost of rent and lack of affordable decent homes.
                        It is not surprising that at a very early stage of its inception, the University thought it wise to embark on provision of houses on Campus for its senior members of staff.  Owing to the fixed number of houses on Campus, the University rented houses off campus which were allocated to qualified staff who could not have campus accommodation.

                        Current Universitys policy on Residential accommodation for Teaching and Administrative staff is in line with the Federal government policy on staff housing. The University used to have staff quarters on campus and annually rented several units for staff outside the campus.  With the monetization policy of government in 2005 when Federal government quarters were sold all over the country, this practice was discontinued.  Since 2005, there has been no single addition to the University's housing stock of 301.

                        As the population of staff grew and getting accommodation in Lagos became very difficult, working in the University and living far from campus became a nightmare.  Over the years, the University only supported staff to acquire their houses outside the campus through the land and building loans.
                        In the last 15 years, allocation of staff Housing on campus has more or less become a yearly balloting for the few units available.  Staffs with the highest scores always have the allocations.  As the pressure continued, allocations have been restricted to main buildings since 2015.  The BQs are allocated to junior and younger staff especially those working as drivers, security, health and Works department.  At the last count there are 181 BQs that have been allocated to these categories of staff.

                        <h1>Maintenance </h1>
                        The Housing Unit in the last two years became more involved in house inspection to ensure that allottees keep their residences in a good state of repair.
                        The University agreed on a maximum threshold of support for renovation for a new allottee.  Changing of accommodation is discouraged and when there is change of accommodation the allottee will bear the cost of repairs except when the element to be repaired is either the roof or any other structural element.
                        As the existing stock become aged, cost of repair became exorbitant and not readily available or accommodated in the University budget.
                        It was observed that upon retirement and vacation of houses, millions of naira are often required to repair individual units of the new allottees. To mitigate these problems, retiring staff are required to put their houses in state of repair before clearances are issued.

                        <h1>Home Ownership</h1>
                        The Unit working with the Center for Housing and Sustainable Development is leading the home ownership drives. About 420 members of staff have made an expression of interest in the Family Home Fund. The Cooperatives and Union members are being packaged for FMBN loans to complete their houses or build a new one in their existing estates or on their private plots.

                    <p>
                        The need to increase the number of the campus accommodation cant be over emphasized. An Architectural design of a proposed 256 units in eight towers have been completed with structural, Electrical Engineering design and financial analysis. These have been submitted to Family Homes Fund. When built, this will bring a lot of relief to the community.

                        Despite the withdrawal of Boys Quarters and allocation of same to staff, the problem of housing is becoming more chronic while members are becoming more desperate and despaired. This impacts negatively on staff health and welfare.  Through it is becoming more challenging to provide housing on campus and on home ownership basis.  The Housing Unit will continue to explore all areas to make housing delivery available to members.

                    <p>
                        The University of Lagos was conceived in 1962 as a non-residential university in line with the recommendation of the Ashby Commission. However, it was soon discovered that majority of the first set of students were not from Lagos. For example, of the 72 students admitted into the Faculties of Business and Social Studies, only 2 came from Lagos. Consequently, the University began to build hostels for the students. By 1965, the following five halls had been built: Hall 1 (Now Mariere), Hall 11 (Moremi), Hall 111 ( EL-Kanemi) which has been pulled down and currently been rebuilt in two phases, phase 1 by the Federal Government and Phase 2 by Rt.Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, Speaker of the National Assembly; Hall 1V (Henry Carr) and Hall V ( Amina). While Halls 1-111 were assigned to male students, Halls 11 and V accommodated female students. In 1973, Jaja Hall was completed as additional male Hostel while Amina and Moremi were extended in 1975. By 1975, the student enrolment figure had increased from 773 in 1965 to 4, 721. The phenomenal increase in students population led to the building of a 2000-bed space capacity New Hall Complex in 1978. Different wings of the complex were designated as Halls and named after prominent Nigerians. These were Eni Njoku Hall (now comprising 202 rooms and 808 bed spaces); Makama Bida Hall (    ); Sodeinde Hall ( 81 rooms and 322 bed spaces); Fagunwa ( ); and Madam Tinubu Hall ( 194 rooms and 776 bed spaces). The enrolment continued to outstrip the provision of hostels. In 1997, the Newest Hall was built. It was subsequently partitioned into two wings, Saburi Biobaku Hall for male students and Lady Kofo Ademola Hall (68 rooms and 550 bed spaces) for female students.  In 2006, Mr. Erastus B.O. Akingbola donated a Hostel, of 57 rooms and 114 bed spaces, to the University. The hostel is located close to Jaja Hall and GTBank. Henry Carr and Erastus Akingbola Halls are for postgraduate students. The students hostel at the old School of Radiography in Yaba has been acquired by the University as a female hostel. The Honours Hostel , near the Distance Learning Institute was built and allocated to female students. On the whole, there are 15 hostels on the campus apart from the ones at Idi Araba. Seven of them are female hostels. They are: Moremi. Lady Kofo Ademola, Madam Tinubu, Honours, Makama Bida, Fagunwa and Queen Amina Halls. The six male Hostels are: Eni Njoku, King Jaja, Mariere, Saburi Biobaku Sodeinde and El- Kanemi Halls. Two Hostels have mixed population, even though the male wing is separated from the female. They are Henry Carr and Erastus Akingbola Halls that accommodate postgraduate students. Apart from these, there are two private hostels on campus. One of these, the University of Lagos Women Society Hostel, was opened in 2017 for female students. The third building is nearing completion. The second is Emerald Hostel, built by the University in partnership with a developer just outside the main Gate and operates on Built, Operate and Transfer basis. The pressure on the University for hostel accommodation has encouraged the University Alumni Association to initiate a 2 billion 500 bed space hostel accommodation project. The first fund raising ceremony was held on 13th October 2017, at Oriental Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos during the 55th Anniversary of the University.
