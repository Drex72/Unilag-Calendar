                <article className="history_content">
                    <p>The Department of Health Services, University of Lagos was established in 1962 when the University was founded. The early geographical locations were in keeping with the Universitys move from temporary sites to the present permanent site. The present Health Centre was constructed between 1972 and 1975. Initially it was a single storey building which in the seventies appeared adequate but due to increase in the scope of services provided, has undergone significant expansion. </p>

                    <p>The Centre was upgraded to a Medical Centre under the dynamic leadership of the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Jelili Adebisi Omotola with the commissioning of an additional floor to the existing building donated by Chief Wahab Iyanda Folawiyo on 13th June 1998.</p>

                    <p>By 2003, the Medical Centre had been transformed into a 30-bed hospital providing both inpatient and outpatient services on a 24-hour basis. In 2008, the long abandoned operating theatre was rehabilitated and made functional and surgical operations commenced in March of same year. An extensive renovation was carried out at the University Medical Centre between 2019 and 2021.</p>

                    <p>The ground floor of the Medical Centre has been renovated to include a modern emergency unit. An additional building has also been added to house the Pharmacy and Preventive Units.</p>

                    <h1 className='history_heading'>OUR VISION</h1>
                    <p>A proactive, healthy and hearty community through access to top class total quality health care</p>

                    <h1 className='history_heading'>OUR MISSION</h1>
                    <p>To provide effective, appropriate, and accessible comprehensive (promotive, preventive, and curative) health care for the University of Lagos community and beyond.</p>

                    <h1>REGULATIONS AND GUILDELINES ON ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LAGOS.</h1>

                    <h1 className='history_heading'>Treatment of University Students</h1>
                    <p>The University regulation initially allowed free medical treatment to full-time students during the period of residence only. With the introduction of the Tertiary Institution Students Health Insurance Plan (TISHIP) in March 2013, coverage is now extended to all categories of university students all year round provided they are registered under the scheme. New students are expected to undergo pre-admission medical screening at the Medical Centre and be certified fit before accommodation in the students hostel. </p>

                    <p>All students registered under TISHIP are expected to access care in the Medical Centre as their Primary Provider through one of the three appointed Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) depending on the Faculty. The three HMOs are Clearline International Ltd, United Healthcare and Mediplan Healthcare. During the holidays, students can access care with their TISHIP identity cards in any hospital registered under the NHIS anywhere in Nigeria. All students are expected to revalidate their TISHIP registration at the beginning of each session.</p>

                    <h1>Treatment of University Staff</h1>

                    <p>The University regulation initially allowed free medical treatment to all staff with their spouses and five children below the age of 18 years. With the introduction of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2006, the number of staff children covered was reduced to four in line with NHIS guideline. In the situation where both husband and wife are employees of the University, only four children of both will be covered.</p>

                    <h1>
                        Treatment of Dependant Relatives
                    </h1>
                    <p>With regards to dependant relatives who are not beneficiaries as in 2 above, the current policy is to charge consultation fee, the amount of which will be based on the recommendation of the Medical Centre Management Board. Where treatment is given and drugs supplied, the cost of the drugs, etc. will be charged. For in-patients, the Medical Centre will charge fees similar to those charged by Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) and a deposit is payable before admission is offered.</p>

                    Medical Services to Temporary Residents on Campus
                    <p>All requests for medical services to temporary residents will be paid for by arrangement with the sponsors of such clients. Formal request for such facilities should be addressed to the Director of Medical Services by the sponsoring organisation.</p>

                    <h1>General Out-Patient Department Consultation (OPD) Time-Table</h1>
                    <p>There will be no normal OPD consultations on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. Emergencies will be seen only when they are real emergencies. There are facilities for the care of sick patients in the sick-bay. For the convenience of students and staff, attention is drawn to the following OPD consultation scheme:

                    Antenatal Clinic 								9:00am-12noon
                    Emergencies
                    To ensure 24 hour coverage,Doctors, Pharmacists, Radiographers and Laboratory Scientists 	take Call Duties while other staff except those in Administrative Unit work the three daily 	shifts. All acute emergencies are seen at the Medical Centre. For those who are neither full-	time students nor members of staff of the University of Lagos, consultation fees are 	chargeable, and where treatment is given, appropriate fee will be charged to cover cost of 	drugs, dressing, accommodation, etc. The doctor on duty will determine what constitutes a 	medical emergency.

                    Maternity Services (Prenatal, delivery and Postnatal Care)
                    In the past, the Medical Centre offered antenatal and postnatal care free to members of staff with confinement in LUTH, Lagos State Government Hospitals and other centres. With the advent of the NHIS and coverage of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th deliveries by capitation, it has become imperative for the Centre to provide delivery services for her clients registered under the scheme.

                    Child Welfare and Reproductive Healthcare Services
                    Child welfare clinic provides growth monitoring, wellness supervision and vaccination based on the National Programme for Immunization (NPI) guideline. At the moment, the Medical Centre provides only family planning counselling services but hope to increase our scope once support is obtained from similar government programs. Family Planning counselling will also be extended to students on request.

                    Pre-Employment Medical Examination
                    Every person appointed in a temporary or permanent capacity, shall be required to present himself or herself for medical examination to the Director of Medical Services (DMS) (or authorized doctor by DMS) with a view to ascertaining whether he or she is physically fit for employment in the University Service. The Provost, Deans and Heads of Departments should ascertain that a prospective employee has been certified medically fit before assumption of duty.

                    The Bursar has been advised to refuse placement on payroll if a prospective staff has not obtained medical clearance from the Medical Centre (as approved by the University of Lagos Advisory Board on Health Services on 5th May, 1983).

                    Retirement on Ill-Health
                    Where the University Director of Medical Services finds that an employees ill health is likely to be further impaired by remaining on duty or on sick list, a Medical Board will be held to determine the employees further relevance in the service of the University. The Medical Board will consist of the University Director of Medical Services and at least two other medical practitioners, one from Government Service and the other from Private Practice. A report should be submitted stating whether permanent or temporary invalidation is recommended.

                    Refund of Medical Expenses
                    Before the advent of the NHIS, the University regulation allowed refund of medical expenses incurred by staff and students when attended to in outside hospitals and also on drugs prescribed by the Medical Centre but not dispensed due to non availability. Since the introduction of the NHIS, refund of all medical expenses including overseas treatment has been cancelled in line with Federal Government guidelines. The cost of treatment not covered by NHIS and TISHIP guidelines will be borne by the recipient.

                    Specialist Consultation Clinics
                    The Medical Centre is registered with the NHIS as a primary care provider and also as a secondary care provider in the four core specialities of Medicine, Surgery, Paediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Thus, the Centre runs weeklySurgical Out-Patient, Medical Out-Patient, Paediatric and Gynaeacology Clinics. Also, general operations such as Lumpectomy, herniorrhaphy, hydocelectomy are done weekly (on Mondays) and gynaecological surgeries fortnightly. Staff relations and outsiders who use these services will pay commercial rates.

                    Other Adjunct Services
                    Theseinclude Manual and Electronic Medical Records keeping, Pharmaceutical Services (drug dispensing and counselling), Laboratory Services (Haematology, Microbiology, Biochemistry and Serology), X-ray services, Ambulance Services and Electrocardiography (ECG) Services.

                    Community Health Education
                    This is done through health tips in University Newsflash, Campus News and other publications,orientation of all cadres of new university students (Undergraduate, Postgraduate, DLI and Foundation), seminars for some special groups e.g. food vendors, porters, etc., weekly health talks on Unilag Radio, Disease-a-Month notice boards at strategic locations on campus, school health program for primary and secondary schools on campus and awareness campaigns such as the World AIDS Day rally and the recently introduced Health week.

                    Health Promotion of the University Community
                    This is done through periodic Staff Medical Screening (SMS) for the prevention and early detection of chronic non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and cancers of the prostate, breast, cervix etc. Bi-annual routine medical screening of all food vendors on Campus, for fitness certification.

                    Preventive/Environmental Services
                    The Medical Centre is in charge of the overall environmental sanitation on campus. This is achieved through its Preventive Unit which undertakes refuse collection and disposal, food and water hygiene and pest and animal control in all the three University Campuses. A task force for the inspection of all food centres, vendors and handlers on campus is operational and advice on environmental, water and food hygiene is given periodically.

                    There are 2 functional refuse vans which were adequate to meet the campus demands until the last few years. This is due to increased refuse generation, addition of another satellite campus to the coverage area, inability of the vans to navigate difficult terrains during rainy season and frequent breakdown of the older vehicle. Management has agreed to procure at least one compactor within the next year to overcome these challenges.

                    KAAF Project
                    The Kesington Adebukunola Adebutu Foundation (KAAF) Maternity and Laboratory Centre donated by Chief Kessington Adebukunola Adebutu and fully furnished with state-of-the-art Maternity equipment is designed to give additional support to the Medical Centre in child delivery and laboratory services at commercial rates for staff, students and outsiders who can afford to pay. Though technically an annexe of the Medical Centre, it runs partially independently as it is expected to be income generating and self sustaining.
                    18.  Human Resource for National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)
                    Part of the requirement for the scheme is the appointment of Desk officers mainly an 		Accounts Officer and an Administrative Officer. This is to cover the large amount of paper 	and accounting work involved in the running of the scheme. An Accounts Officer from 	Bursary has been posted to the Medical Centre to cover this schedule but an Administrative 	Desk Officer is yet to be posted. The need for this is even more glaring with the 	commencement of the Tertiary Institution Students Health Insurance Plan (TISHIP) which 	is another programme under the NHIS.

                    Electronic Medical Records
                    This is at the final phase of its implementation at the University Medical Centre. The EMR 	functions to collect, store and manage patients health information in an electronic form. 	This way, patient management becomes faster and more accurate. It reduces patients 	waiting time in the Medical Centre and there is improvement in health outcomes.
