                    <p>HISTORY

                        The Provisional Council of the University of Lagos made a request to the Federal Ministry of Education in 1966 to start a primary school for the children of staff of the University.

                        Additional advantages to be derived were that:

                        1.	The school would serve as a demonstration school for the Faculty of Education
                        (a successor to the Federal Advance Teachers College).

                        2.	The school would help improve the output of the staff of the University who would have had to collect their children from various schools.

                        The Staff School started operating on 10th October, 1966 on the University Campus at Akoka.  It was housed in a temporary wooden building consisting of 9 classrooms, a small assembly hall and an office for the Headmistress.  It enrolled 156 pupils, including about 30 who were children or non-members of staff of the University.

                        In January 1983, an extension of the school was established to cater for the children of the members of staff of the College of Medicine (CMUL) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).

                        MANAGEMENT
                        The management and control of the Staff School is the responsibility of the Schools Board of Governors, which is a standing committee of the Senate.

                        The day-to-day administration of the School academic and other supporting services is the responsibility of the Headmistress, who is supported by a Deputy Headmistress at the School Annex at Idi-Araba.  The supervisors combine the assignment of supervision with the class teaching.

                        GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

                        SCHOOL POPULATION:
                        The school has continued to grow in leaps and bounds since its inception.  The school now has a population of 1473 pupils as follows:  1217 pupils in the primary section and 256 pupils in the nursery section.

                        STAFF POPULATION:
                        The school has 100 dedicated, qualified and experienced teachers most of whom have first, second degrees and the Headmistress holds a doctorate degree.  The non-teaching staff are 30 in number.

                        NURSERY SECTION
                        It became necessary to start a Nursery Section in the Staff School, when the ULWS which was the feeder Nursery to Staff School, started its own Primary School and stopped sending the Nursery graduands to Staff School.

                        The Staff School Nursery Section was therefore established in September 2008.  It started with eight kids  and now has a population of 256 children.  Due to the rate at which the Nursery is growing, a separate building has been constructed to accommodate the Nursery Section. The building was commissioned in September 2014.  Due to popular request, a nursery section was also added at theCMUL/LUTH Annex at -Idi Araba in September, 2010.

                        CURRICULUM
                        The Staff School offers a wide range of subjects as follows:
