        <TextHeading content='Bursary' />
        <h4>The Bursary:</h4>
        <p>The bursary, which naturally began with the establishment of the University, performs the financial and accounting functions of the University. It is headed by the University Bursar who is, by the University of Lagos Act, the Chief Financial Officer of the University and is responsible to the Vice-Chancellor for the day-to-day administration and control of the financial matters of the University.</p>
        <p>The Department, which started as a small Unit and had the Internal Audit as one of its sections, has developed into a large Department. Following the Federal Government White Paper on the 1986 Visitation Panel Report, the Internal Audit was excised from the Bursary and given a separate status in the Vice-Chancellor's Office.</p>
        <p>In order to enhance efficient and responsible support functions, the Bursary has been re-organized into three divisions, each of which is headed by a Deputy Bursar.</p>
        <p>The first division consists of the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cash Office</li>
          <li>Staff Claims/Staff Advances</li>
          <li>Expenditure Control</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The second division consists of the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Salaries and Wages: responsible for senior and junior staff emoluments and all payments relating to pensioners. Other sections in the division are:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Budget Unit: prepares the annual estimates</li>
            <li>Creditors</li>
            <li>Debtors and Advances Unit: deals with university third parties' financial transactions such as issuance of Local Purchase Orders and settling of customers' invoices</li>
            <li>Self Accounting/Income Generating Unit: oversees all the financial transactions of business outfits like University of Lagos Investment and Development Company (UNIDEV), International School, Human Resources Development Centre (HRDC), Lagos Business School, Staff School, and any income-generating enterprise of the University</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>The third division consists of the following units:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Final Accounts Unit</li>
          <li>Students' Account Unit</li>
          <li>Electronic Data Processing Unit: operates On-Line-Real-Time Processing System to enhance accurate financial information of the University</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h4>Internal Audit Directorate:</h4></p>
        <p>The Internal Audit became functional first as a section of the Bursary in November 1965, manned only by an audit clerk. In March 2020, the Internal Audit Unit became a Directorate, and its scope of responsibility expanded with it.</p>
        <p>The Directorate of Internal Audit carries out independent internal consulting activities in order to evaluate the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes, providing objective assurance to management on these processes and making recommendations that add value and improve the University's operations in achieving its goals and objectives.</p>
        <p>The Directorate is charged with the following duties and responsibilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with policies, plans, procedures, laws, and regulations that could have a significant impact on the University</li>
          <li>Evaluating the means of safeguarding assets and verifying the existence of such assets</li>
          <li>Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the organization's risk management processes and evaluating risk exposure relating to the achievement of the University's strategic objectives</li>
          <li>Monitoring and evaluating governance processes</li>
          <li>Reporting significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks and governance issues</li>
          <li>Performing consulting and advisory services related to governance, risk management, and control</li>
          <li>Evaluating the reliability and integrity of information and the means used to identify, measure, classify, and report such information</li>
          <li>Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency with which resources are employed</li>
          <li>Evaluating operations or programs to ascertain whether results are consistent with established objectives and goals and whether the operations or programs are being carried out as planned</li>
          <li>Evaluating specific operations at the request of management</li>
          <li>Reporting periodically on the internal audit activity, purpose, authority, responsibility, and performance relative to its plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Directorate is under the Vice-Chancellor's Office, and the head reports directly to the Vice-Chancellor.</p>

          <p>
            The University of Lagos Library was established soon after the University of Lagos Act was enacted in April, 1962. The library commenced its operations on the third floor of a former secondary school building at Idi-Araba where the university main campus was temporarily located, and was moved to its present building in August, 1965. The library which opened to readers in 1965 has over the years built a fine and comprehensive collection of research and teaching materials in all fields of knowledge in support of teaching, learning, research and community services. This role has enabled it occupy its rightful place as an academic library, while its importance as the nerve centre of academic activities has continually made it one of the targets of meaningful development within the University community.
          </p>
          <p>
            At inception, the purpose-built building was designed to house library information resources and accommodate 800 readers. Various departments and other basic facilities expected in a university library were integrated in the library design. The first University Librarian was Miss Elizabeth Mary Moys. She began the development of the library collections with the active collaboration of some academic staff. Other senior members of the library staff, who worked with her at this early stage were Mr. C. C. Momoh, Mr. S. A. Orimoloye, Mr. H. A. Odetoyinbo, Mr. A. Nitechi, Mr. B. Amaechi, Mr. P. Shoyinka and others. Miss Elizabeth Mary Moys was in office from 1962 to 1965.
          </p>
          <p>
            The university crisis of 1965 affected various units of the academea and the library was no exception. This led to the resignation of many library staff, including Miss Moys. Mr. Ezekiel Bejide Bankole took over the mantle of leadership in acting capacity between 1966 -1969 but was later confirmed as the substantive University Librarian from 1970 to 1983. Regular acquisitions of resources on reference and other subjects in support of teaching and research efforts of the university community were acquired to aid the growth of the library collection. To complement acquisition efforts of the library, the Indian Merchants Association of Lagos made financial donation as grant-in-aid for the establishment of a collection in honour of Mahatma Gandhi, now popularly known as the Research and Bibliographic Department (Gandhi Library). By September 1963, the University Library had acquired 12,121 volumes and 300 bound serials.  Two years later, the total acquisition was 30,670 volumes. In 1964, engineering materials were added through the funds provided by UNESCO mission working in the Faculty of Engineering. By 1971, the library collections reached 100,000 volumes of books.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the Publications Law (Cap 107 of the Laws) of Lagos State of Nigeria in1973, the Library became a legal depository for two copies of all books published in Lagos State. The Library was also a depository for the publications of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other selected publications of United Nations, UNESCO and FAO. Right from inception of the University, a Library Committee was set up by the University Senate at its inaugural meeting in 1962 with six members. The Committee was to do the following: draw up the regulations for use of the Library, policy development plans, staffing and accommodation. Part of the terms of reference as approved by the Senate included making regulations for the use of the Library, its facilities and provision of advice to the University Librarian on the purchase of expensive books, serials, preparation of estimates for library expenditure and any other matters concerning the library submitted to the Committee. The 1967 University of Lagos Act affected membership of the Library Committee. The Vice-Chancellor or his nominee became the Chairman. It remained a Committee of the Senate with responsibilities for library services. The University of Lagos Decree No.3 of 1967 stipulated that the services of the constituent college libraries be coordinated by the University Librarian.
          </p>
          <p>
            The University Library with the mandate to meet the needs of the University community has its goals as embedded in its vision and mission. These statements of intents reflect the new objectives of the University of Lagos as contained in the 25 years Strategic Plan (2012 - 2037).
          </p>
          <p>
            Library Vision To be the primary and foremost source of reliable information for the University Community, in its quest to realize its noble vision, concerning teaching, research and community services.

              <h4> Organisation of the Library</h4>
              <p>
                The Library over the years has re-organised and reviewed its services and activities to provide a conducive environment for teaching, learning and research. The Library comprises three major departments: Technical Services Department, Readers Services Department and Research and Bibliographic Department (Gandhi Library). With the advancement in technology and the emerging dynamics of the environment, new services and units have since emerged. An example is the Automation unit, charged with the computerisation of various library processes.

              <h4>Technical Services Department </h4>
              <p>
                The Technical Services Department of the University Library consists of Cataloguing, Acquisitions, Serials Sections, Gifts and Exchange Unit and Bindery.
              </p>
              <li>
                <h4>Cataloguing Section</h4>
                <p>
                  The Cataloguing Section is responsible for cataloguing and classification of all Library materials acquired whether by purchase, exchange, gift, or legal deposit. The Library of Congress Classification Scheme and subject headings have been in use since inception of the Library. The section had a crop of competent professionals like Elizabeth Moys, S. A. Orimoloye, G. B. Aina, O. Jegede, S. Ifidon, A. K. Adeniji and others who set the standards of cataloguing practice on which subsequent staff built. Subject Authority, Name Authority, Series Authority and other files were created as well as the shelf list to provide easy retrieval of resources. These served as useful reference data for cataloguers who worked in the section, and became a model for other new libraries that aspired to set up such cataloguing records.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seasoned cataloguers who have passed through the section and made impact in the profession include Mrs. M. I. Ojo, Chief T.O Dada, Mrs. J.O Ugonna, Dr. (Mrs.) H.S. Egberongbe, Mr. A. Ojo, Prof. Y. A Zaid, Dr. (Mrs.) A.O. Alabi and Dr. (Mrs.) N.B. Ukachi.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Serials Section</h4>
                <p>
                  Serials Section oversees the procurement and processing of journals to complement core texts in various academic programmes. The section which subscribed to a few journals at inception witnessed a growth of over 4,000 journal titles in the 1970s. The decline in the university subvention which in turn adversely affected the library resulted in the reduction of journal subscription by almost half in the late nineties (90s). However, the introduction and acquisition of electronic resources since 2005 has improved journal subscription.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Librarians that have worked in the section are Mr. J. O. Lawoyin, Dr. (Mrs.) M. O. Oyesola, Mr. J.B. Falode, Mr. N.A. Kuye, Dr. C.O. Okiki and Dr. (Mrs.) R.O. Odunlade.

              <li>
                <h4>Acquisitions Section</h4>
                <p>
                  The Acquisitions Section has been playing a crucial role in the selection and acquisition of relevant materials in support of all academic programmes. Librarians who have manned this section include: Mr. G. Banjo, Mr O. Osundina, Mrs. O. O. Jegede, Prof. A. O Ike, Mr. E. A. Popoola, Dr. S. O. Olanlokun and Mr. I. Hogan-Bassey. Some of these librarians have headed other libraries in Nigeria. The lean period of the early 1980s and 1990s brought about a decline in resource acquisitions. However, the Federal Government intervention through the Library Development Fund (LDF) has resulted in improvement of print and non-print resources.

              <li>
                <h4>Gifts & Exchange Unit</h4>
                <p>
                  In 1990, the Commonwealth Universities Libraries Exchange Programmes (CULEP) was established in the library to exchange locally published materials with overseas libraries. The objective was to streamline the organisation and handling of donations and exchanges in the library. The exchange programme was a laudable initiative as many notable and expensive materials have been added to Library collection through this source. The exchange programme has since metamorphosed to become a Gift & Exchange unit in the Technical Services Department.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Professionals who have headed the unit include: Mrs. M.O. Aderibigbe, Mrs P.O. Ohiomoba, Mrs. O. Balogun, and Mr. S. A. Babatunde.

              <li>
                <h4>Bindery Unit</h4>
                <p>
                  The Bindery Unit was established to provide ancillary services for the library. Services provided by the unit include general book binding for the library, students, staff, researchers, and the general public. The unit had a team of trained professionals in book mending and binding. The unit has continued to evolve in service delivery to meet the high level of quality service demanded by clients.
                </p>

            <li>
              <h4> Readers Services Department </h4>
              <p>The Readers Services Department functions as the public relations section of the library where patrons meet library staff for service provision. The Department coordinates activities of service units which include: Circulation, Reference, Reserved Book Room, Law Library, Boulos Engineering Library, Reading Halls, Faculty and Center libraries. Readers Services has evolved over the years as the deployment of information technology in service delivery has enhanced user patronage as evidenced in the number of registered students reported in the published 2020 Library Annual Report. The Department also coordinates library tours and exhibitions, as well as activities of Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) for Library and Information Science students across the country. Librarians who have anchored activities in the department include late Mrs. B. F. Olaniyan, Mr. M. O. Olaitan, Mr. A. K. Adeniji, Mrs. J. A. Ugonna, Mr. J.O. Lawoyin, Dr (Mrs.) M. O. Oyesola, Mr. I. Hogan Bassey, Dr. (Mrs.) H.S. Egberongbe and Prof. Y.A Zaid.   </p>
              <p>Boulos Engineering Library Boulos Enterprises Limited offered financial assistance to the University for acquisition of Engineering textbooks and journals for postgraduate students and lecturers to serve as the nucleus of the Boulos Engineering collection. An initial sum of N30,000 grant was given to the Library during the 1987/88 session, and another N25,000 in 1990. The grant was given for five consecutive years. In addition, the company furnished a section of the library now known as the Boulos Engineering Library with shelves, carrels and furniture. Through this benevolent gesture, the Boulos Engineering Library came into existence.</p>

              <h4>Automation Unit</h4>
              <p>The automation Unit was established in 1996 to promote the computerisation of various library processes. The unit was charged with the responsibility of having all library activities driven by Information and Communication Technologies. To date, almost all the library functional areas and services have a touch of automation. Librarians who have worked in the unit include: Dr. T.M. Salisu, Dr. E. A. Popoola, Dr. O.O. Adediji, Dr O.O. Durodolu, Dr. C.O. Okiki and Mrs. O.M. Olatise. </p>

          <p>Application of Information Technology to library services had been in the dream barely ten years after the University Library came into existence in 1962. The interest then was to ease the burden of the problems affecting research, teaching, and learning. To realize the ambition, the Library Management given its knack for state-of-the-art service, quickly considered the computerization of some of its operations. The series of activities in this direction culminated in the commissioning of a Plessey Library Lending System on 2nd September 1982.</p>

          <p>For technical reasons, the system, regrettably, turned out to be a "still-born baby". However, it is to be noted that prior to the installation of a Plessey system, some areas of library operations had been mechanically driven. A sizeable number of the collections (theses, newspapers, documentaries, instructional materials, etc.) were acquired in Micro-Readers/Reader-Printers. Others are Se-Lin Tape Labeller for the classification number of the spine of books. Catalogue cards were produced with the Weber machine: accessioning of books done with Numbering machine; elevator facilitated the movement of Library materials (Books and journals) from one floor to the other.</p>

          <p>Late in 1982, the bulkiness of the already acquired newspapers and magazines became threatening, storage space was becoming the issue. The Library management, in its wisdom, opted for the purchase of a Microfilming equipment. In 1983, Microfilm Box (an equipment) was installed and commissioned at the Education Library. This evidently had a tremendous impact on the documentation and storage of newspapers and some other documents.</p>

          <p>Another attempt presented itself in 1995 under the Nigerian Universities Commissions' (NUC) initiative through the World Bank project. The NUC acquired and installed a 4-user TINLIB v.270 and a 3861CL Computer System in all the Federal university libraries, in which the University of Lagos Library was a beneficiary. This gesture geared the Library management (Messrs A. K. Adeniji, M.O. Olaitan, and Dr. S.O. Olanlokun) in conjunction with Messrs E.A. Popoola and Jonathan Oyovwevotu of the Automation Unit to form a team charged with the planning and implementation of Library Automation Programmes/Projects. The team recommended and got approval from the University for the installation of a 50-user Local Area Network (LAN) in a Netware 4.1 operating system environment and an upgrade of TINLIB to version 280 with a 25-user license. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Admin.), Prof. S.A. Adekola, commissioned the Local Area Network, which was installed by Inlaks Computers - a renowned computer company, on the 8th of March, 1996.</p>

          <p>With the LAN in place, the challenge was that of technological enhancement to improve service delivery. Apart from the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) derivable from TINLIB application package, other facilities and services provided include search for a variety of resources on CD-ROM, rendering assistance on request, acquiring or sourcing for document/information anywhere which hitherto was not readily available locally at a reasonable cost and e-mail services to enable scholars to communicate faster with colleagues worldwide on areas of common interest.</p>

          <p>
            In December 1997, Mr. Adegoke Kolade Adeniji was appointed University Librarian and at his first management meeting, he declared that the year 2000 should be targeted as the date for total library automation. The Library stock of 350,000 books and over 150,000 bound journals were gradually but steadily keyed into the computer system in preparation for the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC), the home-grown bibliographic databank. Barely five years into the deployment and use of TINLIB software, was its inadequacy for a growing library collection discovered. Moreover, the local vendor, BUSICON Limited and the manufacturer of the package EOSi of the United Kingdom were no longer providing support services as new and improved Library Management System had been developed.   By 2001, there was a compelling need to replace the TINLIB with Graphical Library Automation System (GLAS). The challenge therefore posed to Dr. Simeon Olajire Olanlokun (now Late), the then University Librarian was data migration which was successfully completed at the end of 2003. The Library migrated from the use of the GLAS software to Millenium Software in 2012. Due to inadequate technical support, from the supplier, conversion of the library bibliographic records to Machine-Readable format was stalled in 2015 until June 2019 when the library deployed a TETFUND sponsored Library Management Software called the NewGenLib under the headship of Prof. Yetunde Zaid. NewGenLib is a Web based application software which enables remote access to collection housed in various library locations through the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC).

        <div className="no4">
          <p>Certificate in Library and Information Science The Library in conjunction with UNILAG Consult started the Certificate in Library and Information Science Programme as a short-term course for library assistants, clerks and others who work in Libraries, Documentation and Information Centres. The programme was later taken over by the Human Resources Development Board.  </p>
          <p>Diploma Programme The Library in collaboration with the Distance Learning Institute developed a Diploma in Library and Information Science Programme. The programme was approved by the Board of Studies of the Institute. The first set of students was admitted in 2001.  </p>
          <p>C. Bachelor of Library and Information Science Degree Programme Under the leadership of Prof. Yetunde Zaid, the Library Management submitted a proposal to the Academic Planning Committee for the establishment of Bachelor of Library and Information Science Degree. The programme was recommended to the University Senate and was approved on 24th February, 2021. The National University Commission (NUC) conducted the resource verification exercise on 31st January 2022. </p>

          <h4> Developments in the University Library (2012 -2022) </h4>
          <p>Like many academic libraries, the University of Lagos Library services, processes and structure have grown over the years by capturing major trends and embracing emerging technologies, thereby shaping the future of academic libraries in Nigeria. The library which is poised to continually reinvent itself to become a bold, vibrant and an essential contributor to learning, teaching and research aspirations of the university, as circulated in the Universitys 25 years Strategic Plan (2012 -2037).  </p>
          <p>
            Developments in the library in the last ten years (2012  2022) were focused on three (3) areas namely:
            <ul>
              <li>Library Services</li>
              <li>Facility Improvement</li>
              <li>Human Capital Development</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Library Services </h4>
              <p>The University Library current services, processes and structure has shifted from traditional outlook to more digitally-driven practices. Within 2012 to 2022, the library environment became more welcoming in outlook, and digitally enabled with introduction of additional e-services. Various aspects of improved library services are enumerated under the following sub headings </p>
              <p> MTN Foundation (MTNF) UniversitiesConnect Facility The e-Library, sponsored by the MTN Foundation was commissioned on the 14th December 2005 under Prof O. Ibidapo-Obe led Management. The objective of the facility was to facilitate access to electronic resources for students, staff, and the university community. Operation was halted with the facility locked up for six years (2011-2016) as a result of disagreement between the University of Lagos and MTNF/NETLibrary, on terms and agreement as stated in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). However, the facility was re-opened in April 2017 during Prof. R.A Bellos administration and handed over to the University Library for management and supervision. The e-Library currently subscribes to various fee-based databases and open sources which cut across various disciplines. Thedatabases with e-books and e-journals platforms are hosted on the library website. Access is mainly via the university Internet Protocol (IP). </p>
              <p><h4>Visually Impaired Resource Centre:</h4> The Visually Impaired Resource Centre, established in 2016, is located at the library basement. It caters for the learning and research needs of students with visual impairment. The Centre is equipped with assistive technology such as hardware (computers braille embossers and scanners), software (screen readers, screen magnification, voice recognition), and Internet access. Services provided include transcription and conversion of learning resources to accessible formats either braille or audio format, scanning of course materials, research assistance, etc. The center is managed by Mr. E. Obodoma (a visually impaired staff) and Mr A. Adekola (a sighted staff) under the supervision of Dr. (Mrs.) Egberongbe, head, Readers Services Department, and Prof. Y.A. Zaid, the University Librarian.</p>
              <p><h4>Optimisation of Institutional Repository (IR):</h4> In accordance with international best practices, the University Library set up the Institutional Repository in 2016 to manage scholarly output of the academic community and improve the visibility of the university. The (IR) is Google optimized for better visibility. The Library is committed to continually uploading born-digital documents while resources in print formats are digitized for uploading. It is worth noting that the library secured the approval of the University Senate in 2017 on policies guiding the management of the Institutional Repository (IR). Policies approved are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Policy guiding the submission of staff publications</li>
                  <li>Review of the University of Lagos policy on Institutional Repository - uploading of full text of Ph.D. Theses</li>
                  <li>Signing off of Ownership Rights of Theses submitted to the University of Lagos (Library)</li>
                </ul>
                In February 2020, the library trained academic staff on how to self-archive their academic output and upload the same on IR, thereby ensuring wide dissemination and increased visibility of academic content of the University of Lagos. Prof. Y. A. Zaid and Dr. C. O. Okiki worked with Dr. V. Odumuyiwa, of the Department of Computer Science on installation and configuration of the IR.</p>
              <p><h4>Online Public Access Catalogue:</h4> In 2019, the University Library deployed a TETFUND funded Library Management Software (LMS) called NewGenLib, a proprietary Software designed to automate library processes. The NewGenLib is a Web-based Application Software that enables access to literature/document search derivable from the application package. What was different and interesting about the deployment of the NewGenLib software is the fact that there was no existing Machine-Readable Cataloguing (MARC) data to be migrated into the newly deployed LMS. A gradual retrospective conversion approach was adopted to capture the stock of over 504,000 books and 700,000 bound for the take-off of the Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC), which was successfully launched on 14th June 2019.</p>

              <p><h4>Notebook/Tablet Loan Services:</h4> The library introduced the notebook computer loan service in 2012 as an innovative service to support learning and research. However, this service was complemented in January 2022 when the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe deployed 500 Modio Tablets to the library from what Dr. Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank donated to the University of Lagos. The objective is to support access to learning resources for students and library users. Tablet workstations displayed with anti-theft casing on every floor of the library were commissioned on 11th February 2022.</p>

              <p><h4>New Reference Unit and Introduction of Chat-A-Librarian Service:</h4> A new Reference Section was set up within the main library in 2016 as a replacement for the old Reference Section at the Akintunde Ojo building, which was vacated for the use of the MTN E-Library. The new Reference Library is equipped with current reference materials. For effective reference service delivery, Chat-a-Librarian, an aspect of Ask-a-Librarian service, was introduced in May 2020 during COVID-19 restrictions. The initiative enables library users to get quick help in finding information on library services and resources.</p>

              <p><h4>Improved Inter-library loan and Document Delivery:</h4> The impact of the library service delivery mechanisms has been enhanced by deepening collaboration among other academic libraries in other universities across the country via the inter-library loan and document delivery services. The period spanning 2012-2022 was characterized with improved collaboration between the library and faculty, as well as improved awareness of the varied resources available for teaching, learning, and research.</p>

              <p><h4>Deployment of Robotic Technology to Library Services:</h4> History was made on the 29th of June 2020 when the University Library received a donation of a Robot from Platform Capital. The initiative was indeed a step towards evolving UNILAG library to a smart library. The robot named Roboscholar has been programmed to perform quick reference services, help users find books, enhance book categorization, track headcount, and create a user-friendly and welcoming environment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><h4>Human Capital Development:</h4> The University library has continually disposed itself to contributing its quota to the development of human capital.</p>
              <p><h4>Contribution to Human Capital Development:</h4> The University library is contributing to human capital development by serving as a vibrant ground for the Students' Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) for Library and Information Science students across the country. The Library has trained over two hundred undergraduate and post-graduate students between 2012 to 2022.</p>
              <p><h4>Contributions of Staff to the Development of other Libraries:</h4> Staff who worked in the University of Lagos Library system have made meaningful contributions to the development of other libraries in Nigeria. Examples are:
                <ul>
                  <li>Mr. Gboyega Banjo, former Director, Library and Documentation Department, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs</li>
                  <li>Mr. George Affia, University Librarian, University of Port Harcourt</li>
                  <li>Professor Sam Ifidon, University Librarian, Bendel State University</li>
                  <li>Dr. Nath Adeyemi, Librarian, Institute for Strategic Studies, Jos</li>
                  <li>Mr. Oarthe, Librarian, Auchi Polytechnic</li>
                  <li>Mr. Shoyinka, Librarian, Lagos State Polytechnic</li>
                  <li>Mr E. Ayo Popoola - former Director of Nigerian Institute of International Affairs Library</li>

                </ul>
                Many have contributed to the literature of librarianship. For the most critical years of its existence, Mr. E.B. Bankole, the first indigenous University Librarian, was the Editor of Nigerian Libraries. Some other staff of the University of Lagos Library who served either on the editorial board or as editors of library and information science (LIS) journals include: Dr. Oyesola and Mr. A.K. Adeniji, Mrs. Ugonna, Dr. S.O. Olanlokun, Dr. T.M. Salisu, Dr. (Mrs.) H.S. Egberongbe, and Dr. O.O. Adediji were at one or the other time editors of Lagos Librarian. Mrs. M.R. Aderibigbe was the Regional Editor for Africa Government Publications Review. In addition, some academic librarians taught in the Faculty of Arts as associate lecturers, especially in the area of bibliography, research methods, and documentation.</p>
              <p><h4>Appointment of Professor Librarian:</h4> On 8th October 2021, the University of Lagos Governing Council appointed Yetunde Zaid, the University Librarian as Professor, making her the pioneer Librarian to be appointed as Professor Librarian in the University of Lagos effective 14th March 2019. The Governing Council noted that due process for appointment as Professor Librarian was followed and the cadre/structure was in the Establishment as capsulated in the Condition of Service for Senior Staff.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><h4>Staffing:</h4> At present, the staff strength is one hundred and forty-one (141), made up of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Professional (18)</li>

        <h4>WORKS AND PHYSICAL PLANNING DEPARTMENT</h4>
        <p>Background</p>
        <p>At the inception of the University, and in order to provide for maintenance of the staff quarters and the temporary halls of residence, a small maintenance unit was established at Idi-Araba under the control of a Maintenance Officer, Mr. A.C. Kerri. The work of the unit was not heavy at the beginning as most of the buildings, electrical installations and telecommunication equipment needing attention were new and for some of them the contractor's retention period covered a long period. In October, 1963 a Resident Engineer in person of Engr. S. A. Odunsi, MNSE was appointed due to increase in the number of houses, equipment and installations. A limited number of intermediate and junior technical staff were recruited by him to augment the existing skeleton maintenance staff. He was later re-designated Chief Engineer. He thus became the first Head of Department who laid the foundation for Works and Services Department, the scope of responsibilities of which had expanded with the growth of the University.</p>
        <p>Between 1976 and 1986, Works and Services Department was restructured into two main divisions namely, Construction Division under an Ag. Chief Engineer and Maintenance Divisions under one Ag. Chief Maintenance Officer whose responsibility was performed by the then Registrar, Mr. M. Olu Eperokun who assumed duty as the third substantive Registrar of the University. This arrangement or structure provided for a central control office under a substantive Chief Engineer who was designated Acting Assistant Director of Works. The new dispensation gave head of sections on grade level 10 and above, financial responsibility over fund budgeted for such sections.</p>
        <p>The new arrangement appeared to have created a ploy to undermine the authority of the Ag. Assistant Director of Works thus creating a row between the Registrar, acting for University Administration and the Ag. Assistant Director of Works. Subsequent events did not give room for the resolution of ensuing conflicts until a substantive Director of Works that was directly responsible to the Vice-Chancellor was appointed. Prior to what is now known as Works and Physical Planning Department, a Physical Planning Office was in existence in the Vice-Chancellor's office. In 1982, the Physical Development Unit, headed by a Director which was saddled with the responsibility of 'assisting' the Administration with the physical development of the University in collaboration with the University's Master Planners, was created within the Vice-Chancellor's office. In addition, the Unit served as internal consultant on the work of external contractors and consultants and as 'auditors' to monitor performance of Works and Services Department.</p>
        <p>Between 1978 and 1980, maintenance of physical structure and University grounds suffered neglect due to crisis. There was overlap of functions and 'everybody's job became nobody's work'. With the support of the then Vice-Chancellor, the Director of Works embarked on restructuring of the Department of Works in 1981. The emergent structure, which has since been retained, includes the Control Section which embraces the Director's Office. Other Units include Administration, Accounts, Purchasing and Stores, the Maintenance Section which covers non-residential buildings and hostels, senior staff housing; Electrical/Mechanical, Refrigerator and Air-conditioning Section; Transport and Estate Sections and the Project Management Unit.</p>

        <h1>COUNSELLING UNIT</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The University of Lagos Counselling Centre, a Unit under the Student Affairs Division of the Office of the Vice Chancellor, was established to assist clients (students and staff) in coping with academic, vocational, socio-personal, and other related problems that may affect their educational and life goals. To meet these needs, the Centre offers a variety of services with the ultimate hope of resolving individual problems. The services are in the form of individual and group counselling.
        </p>

        <h2>Services provided at the Centre</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Individual Counselling: Clients have the opportunity to discuss their concerns with the professional Counsellor.</li>
          <li>Group Counselling: Clients have the opportunity to share their concerns with the professional Counsellor and others who have similar or related challenges. Group Counselling is made up of two or more persons and is usually conducted as expedient and is led by the professional Counsellor.</li>
          <li>Academic Counselling: Students have the opportunity to discuss educational problems with the Counsellor. Counsellors organize training programs to assist students in developing a positive attitude towards study, culminating in adequate preparation for tests and examinations. This helps reduce the menace of examination malpractices resulting from inadequate preparations.</li>
          <li>Vocational Counselling: Counsellors and students work together to examine and determine several alternative occupational or vocational choices resulting from the student's academic program.</li>
          <li>Marital Counselling: This service is provided to resolve issues that often arise in homes between couples. It is offered to students, staff, and the public.</li>
          <li>Rehabilitation Counselling: This service is often provided for students and other clients who desire change after being involved in certain maladaptive behaviors, e.g., cultism, alcoholism, smoking, indiscriminate sexual behavior, drug abuse, etc.</li>
          <li>Orientation Programme: The orientation of new students to the University usually takes place in the early weeks of resumption. The program enables new students to settle down and adjust to university life. As part of the orientation activities, new students are able to meet the Vice Chancellor, Principal Officers, their respective Deans, Senior Administrative Officers, and are introduced to various facilities in the university, including the University Library. Many other services are available either on request or when occasions call for them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ethics of the Counselling Profession</h2>
        <p>
          Confidentiality: All discussions, dialogue, and interviews are totally confidential. Records and information are not released to anyone except on specific request by the client.
        </p>

        <h2>Arrangement for Interview</h2>
        <p>
          The Counselling Centre provides services on a walk-in basis from Monday to Friday, starting at 8:00 a.m. and closing at 5:00 p.m. At other times, it is strictly by appointment.
        </p>

        <h2>Seminar/Workshop Programmes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Leadership Training: This program is meant to equip newly elected Students Union Executives and other similar bodies in their leadership activities.</li>
          <li>Assertive Training: This program is aimed at equipping people to be self-assured and think positively.</li>
          <li>Social Skills Training: The program is aimed at providing positive behavior to replace the maladaptive behaviors exhibited by clients.</li>
          <li>Other Seminar/Workshop topics are also made available on request.</li>
        </ul>

            In line with the mission of the University of Lagos, which is to provide a conducive environment for teaching, learning, research and development, where staff and students will interact and compete effectively with their counterparts globally, the Quality Assurance & SERVICOM Unit was established in the University on May 12, 2012 under the Office of the Vice Chancellor. The Unit is responsible for the internal Quality Assurance System (QAS) aimed at setting up, maintaining and improving the quality and standard of teaching, scholarship (student learning experience), research and service to the community. The overall objective of the Quality Assurance mechanism of the Unit is to continuously promote and improve on the quality of the core activities of the University as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since its establishment, the Unit has been led by four (4) Directors: Prof. C. Igwilo (who doubled as the Director of Academic Planning); its pioneer Director, Prof. S. A. Okunuga; and his two successors: Prof. L. O. Chukwu and Prof. G. O. Otinwa. Under these Directors and the following Deputy Directors: Dr. I. I. C. Nwokoro (now a professor); Dr. S. A. Oladipo; and Dr. S. O. Azumurana, the Unit has always placed a high premium on the key objective of monitoring and evaluating the Universitys core activities of teaching and learning using various instruments such as the Students Course and Lecturer Evaluation form; Lectures and Examination Assessment forms; and the Classroom Environment Assessment form. These monitoring and evaluation instruments keep producing very interesting and amazing results which help the University management in putting appropriate mechanisms in place for the improvement of service delivery. The current Quality Assurance Committee was inaugurated by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, in November 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            To effectively discharge its mandate, the Quality Assurance & SERVICOM Unit is sub-divided into two (2) arms:  the Quality Assurance sub-unit and the SERVICOM sub-unit. As presently constituted, the two sub-units put together comprise two (2) academic staff and nine (9) non-teaching staff as follows: (Prof. G.O. Otinwa	-Professor/Director, QAS  Dr. S. O. Azumurana Senior Lecturer/Deputy Director, QAS(Mr. J.A. Adeniyi-Principal Assistant Registrar (PAR)  (    Mrs. Kosoko-King-Principal Assistant Registrar (PAR)(Mrs. O. J.
