                    CENTRE FOR AFRICAN REGIONAL INTEGRATION AND BORDER STUDIES.
                    Year Established:  13 September, 2000
                    Location: C/o Department of History and Strategic Studies.
                    Current Director: Prof. R.T. Akinyele.
                    Regional Integration is widely acknowledged as a solution to the widening political and economic crisis of contemporary Africa. The Centre is the first of its kind in Africa, established by a tertiary institution to focus on the twin- issues of boundaries and African Integration. At inception and up till 2008, the Centre was located on the 4th Floor of the Senate Building. It was initiated by Prof. A.I. Asiwaju, Africas foremost Border Scholar and patterned after the Programme on International Co-operation in Africa (PICA), of the Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States in 1989. The Centre is designed to examine the problems and opportunities presented by the national boundaries established by European colonial powers and inherited by African States at independence. The research thrust of the Centre revolves around the issues of Labour Migration, Transboundary Crimes and Policing, Transboundary Resources Management, Cross- border Trade and Food Security, Political Insecurity and Ethnic Relations Across Africas International Boundaries. The Centre is designed to take full advantage of the multidisciplinary strength of the various faculties and departments to provide the coordinating point in relevant research in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Law, Community Health and Biological Sciences. It also holds workshops and seminars for border managers, notably staff of the Department of Customs and Excise, Immigration Service, Police, State Security Services and the National Boundary Commission. Since inception, the Centre has published many books on African Boundaries and African Integration. The pioneer Director was Prof. A. I. Asiwaju who retired from the service of the University in 2004. He was succeeded by Prof. R.T. Akinyele. The goal of the Centre is to forge linkages with national and international research institutions, to ensure the financial and institutional support that will propel the Centre to become a Centre of Excellence in Border Studies in Africa.

                    The Centre is the outcome of the fruitful collaboration with the International Centre for Law and Religion Studies (ICLARS) of Brigham Young University (BYU), Provo, Utah in the United States. It began with an International Conference on Law and Religion Studies, held from 23-28 February,2014 at the University of Lagos. The Conference had three components: 
                    An intensive training course in Law and Religion for Law student volunteers.
                    A Train the Trainers Seminar Series for lecturers to prepare them to teach Law and Religion as a distinct course when it is introduced into the Law curriculum.
                    An international conference on Law and Religion targeted at the members of the Lagos Bar Association.
                    Since then, BYU and its partners have consistently involved the Faculty of Law in several other conferences on Law and Religion including the ones held in Windhoek, Namibia (18-19 May, 2015); Cape Town (20-22 May, 2015); and Oxford University (21-23 June 2015). The International Centre for Law and Religion Studies also supported the Faculty of Law to host the First National Judicial Roundtable on the Intersection between Law and Religion in 2016.  The International Conference on Law and Religion is growing bigger every year.

                    Centre for Autism and Neuro-Developmental Disorders (CAND-DO)Year of Establishment	2018Where Domicile/Location RBRR Building, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Idi-ArabaCurrent DirectorProfessor J.D. AdeyemiFollowingthe approval of the Senate of the University of Lagos, for the establishment of the Center for Autism andNeurodevelopmental Disorders (CAND-Do) among other Research Centres in the University of Lagos, CAND-Do had her official inauguration on the 28th of February 2018 in the Old Great Hall of the College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Idi-araba. The Keynote address delivered by Prof.IsaacUkpokolo of the Department of Philosophy, University of Ibadan focused on Autism spectrum and Neurodevelopmental disorders: Gaps in research, Care and National  other subthemes and the event was well attended by the members of the University Management team, staff of the University, partners and various stakeholders in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).
                    CAND-Do Steering Committee provides oversight and management of all CAND-DOs scientific and operational activities. It is Chaired by the Director and includes CAND-Dos Heads of Research Programmes and Senior staff members.
                    CAND-Do Board comprises of some senior officials of the major partner institutions and some selected reputable individuals in the society with interest in ASD. It is a six-man Committee with a Chairman and the Director of CAND-Do also a member. It performs an advisory role through periodic review of CAND-Do strategies to achieve her goals as well as galvanize supports for the activities of the Centre to ensure standards are maintained, and continuous progress in research and service delivery are sustained.The vision of the Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders (CAND-Do) of the College of Medicine of University of Lagos is a multifaceted and focus driven Center that is positioned to address the research, learning and service needs of persons and caregivers of those living with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.Outline of Achievements:
                    Activity Report for 2018, 2019, 2020 & 2021. 

                    CAND-Do Outreach:
                    At CAND-Dos inauguration in February 2018, the Centre was able to generate list of individuals who wish to partner with CAND-Do as volunteers in support of her activities. The volunteers who cut across various disciplines and specialties, including some ASD care-givers, provide pool of supports that can easily be accessed in the execution of her various programmes and activities. The enlistment of volunteers is, however, a continuous exercise in CAND-Do.
                    The team of experts from CAND-Do partner with the GTBank to execute 2018 Autism Conference and Consultation between17th -23rd July 2018 at the Muson Centre and Digital Village Ikeja respectively. Some of our team members presented a symposium at the GTB Annual Conference and specifically introduced the maiden edition of the session that addressed professional practitioners. Our members anchored the team of experts from LUTH, Neuropsychiatric Hospital Aro and Blazing Trail International among others to carry out the Consultation session which ended up seeing about 255 clients of which a sizeable number screened were ASD.  Data generated from this engagement have added to the existing information for further analysis in the knowledge and management of ASD in Nigeria. While the one-week programme lasted, CAND-Do has continued to extend services from time to time to referred clients and caregivers from this event who attend our weekly clinic for consultations in specific areas of need.
                    The maiden CAND-Do Autism Stakeholders Forum which was held in December 5, 2018 was organized as an annual event to consolidate a network of collaborations that will entrench possible strategies towards service improvement in the management of ASD. It was well attended by some professionals and major practitioners in Lagos who specialize in identified areas of need associated with ASD. The Forum succeeded in identifying critical areas of attention for ASD that are often unaddressed in which practitioners would expect a Research Centre like CAND-Do to provide leadership.
                    In 2019 CAND-Do Organized yet another symposium as part of the GTB Annual Conference and specifically introduced the maiden edition of the session that addressed professional practitioners. Our members anchored the session and the team of experts were from the CMUL and other institutions. Participation of health professionals at the symposium was very good Symposium Topics : (1)Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Technology  Interface in ASD Management. (Dr Mashudat Bello-Majeed, FNPHY). (2) Utility of Cannabis Oil in Autism Management  Current Trends. (Dr Yetunde Adeniyi, UCH/CMUOI).  (3).  Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR):   A tool for early Autism Diagnosis  Evidence and Prospects. (Dr Chinyere Aseogwu  CMUL/LUTH)
                    Year 2019 also saw the quarterly support group activities continue. Assessments also continued at the autism center and guidance given to parents and caregivers regarding services in the community. All of which contributed to our data base.
                    Year 2020 and 2021  these 2 years have been challenging due to the covid 19 restrictions on gathering and many health concerns of our users as well as volunteers which affected our services adversely. Ernest effort is in place currently by the team to prepare for an active relaunch in 2022.


                    CAND-Do Research
                    CAND-Do Research is the core of the Centre. CAND-Do Research constitutes four different research focus teams with multidisciplinary membership in each. The focus areas include Translational Autism research, Autism and Music, Epidemiology of Autism as well as Care giver and family research. Each team in the year 2018 was assigned the responsibility of completing a minimum of two research proposals of which some are nearing the final stage of submission for sponsorship. As each team continues to work on its focus area, membership of CAND-Do research team is still open to multidisciplinary University community whose interest or specialty is relevant to the goal of the Centre.
                    Research Group meets together on monthly basis to review proposals and consider calls for application from various funders around the world.

                    Contributions to National Development and Relationship with SDG
                    The TETFund project will help to improve electoral practice and democratic governance in Nigeria. It will also advance public understanding of the geo-politics of data-centric technologies that is integral for creating new means of improving the overall political culture in the public space.  It will provide useful information on strategies that will address contemporary challenges facing Nigerian fledgling democracy. Political actors, stakeholders and policy makers will better appreciate the role of technology in democratic practice. It may help to curb ballot stuffing/snatching, electoral conflicts, post-election violence, hate speech, fake news and contribute to the promotion of participatory democracy, good governance, peaceful and credible elections,
                    The 3 major projects being handled at the Centre for Digital Humanities connect with and contribute broadly to 3 Sustainable Development Goals. These are:
                    1. HYPERLINK "http://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal9.html"GOAL 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
                    2. HYPERLINK "http://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal16.html"GOAL 16: Peace and Justice Strong Institutions
                    3. HYPERLINK "http://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/envision2030-goal17.html"GOAL 17: Partnerships to achieve the Goal
                    The digital humanities projects and programmes funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and Volkswagen Foundation, Germany, for instance, focus on developing capacity that will promote industry growth, innovation and infrastructure. Digital Humanities (DH) contributes hugely to an emerging technology-driven research and innovation area of research at the intersection of computer science, Information technology and the broad fields of humanities. Projects in DH also promote the production of new technologies, software and applications that will serve both socio-economic, political and national interests. These programmes are equally underpinned by the capacity to promote partnerships to achieve the goal based on the multidisciplinary and multinational components of the Summer School programmes. Participants from some West Africa countries participated in the programmes. 
                    On the project sponsored by TETFund, it is believed that the outcome will enhance credible elections, transparency and accountability on governance thereby promoting peace and justice and strong institutions. 
                    Projections.
                    The Centre hopes to escalates its activities and drive to attract research grants. The Centre also hopes to process its application for a postgraduate programme in Digital and Public Humanities as soon as possible. The Centre is becoming an intellectually-stimulating international research platform for scholars and researchers within and outside Africa willing to investigate different ways in which digital technologies are redefining approaches to research and knowledge production in the human sciences. It is anticipated that as the Centre continues its various training and research programmes in Digital Humanities, the efforts will cascade into rebranding the humanities programmes, retooling staff and students, enhancing the international ranking of theUniversity. The activities of the Centre will also contribute to the development of human capital that will deploy web-based technologies which anticipatorily will impact personal and social experiences of man in modern society and enhance the drive towards a knowledge-based society.

The diagnostic section carries out various laboratory testing on patients samples with suspected viral infections. Currently, CHAZVY is one of the reference testing Centres for the COVID-19, Viral Haemorrhagic fevers, Lassa virus, arboviruses as well as other viruses of public health importance. The Centre is also majorly involved in research for the development/evaluation of testing kits and identification of new viral biomarkers. 
                    Our research beam focuses on using different approaches ranging from: Epidemiology-Phytochemistry-Bioinformatics & Structural Biology-Biochemistry & Molecular Biology-Immunology in Virology to solving and explaining infection processes for the development of relevant anti-viral products. The drug development unit investigates possible therapeutic bio-actives from natural products isolated and purified using planar and column chromatographic techniques in tissue culture systems and animal models. The Centre has also embraced the use of in-silico analysis by the bioinformatics unit for primers and probe designs in PCR based applications such as pathogen detection, gene expression assays, genotyping and multiplexing PCR to enhance sensitivity and specificity of PCR assays. Part of its current endeavours is the in-silico drug screening using molecular docking/ligand fitting softwares for structure activity relationship of chemical structures of new molecules, 3D viral proteins deposited on the protein databank (PDB), development of recombinant vaccines and ELISA based detection kits for viral agents circulating in Nigeria, drug testing, cloning & protein expression experiments, and maintenance of pure viral isolates for further studies.Vision/Mission/PhilosophyThe vision of the Centre is to provide Leadership in human and zoonotic virology in research, health services, capacity building and policy in Nigeria, West Africa and the World, based on our core values which includes, Integrity, Teamwork, Innovation, Transparency, Accountability, Excellence of Quality, Respect for the dignity of the person or individual.

                    The platform started as The Tropical Diseases Research Laboratory in 2002 at CMUL as a Research Group with focus on malaria and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). In late 2005, this platform was selected by the WHO/TDR as one of the four Malaria Specimen Bank Site for Africa. The other sites were in Kenya, Tanzania and Democratic Republic of Congo. This Site was supported through WHO/TDR Grant No. A50734 and this formed the basis for the trajectory of the numerous activities of this Centre which has remained relevant among the sites in Africa with the highest contribution to the Global Malaria Specimen Bank domiciled in the Centre for Diseases Control, Atlanta, Georgia, USA . The Centre for Malaria Diagnosis, Research, Training and Policy was established by Senate in 2021 to consolidate the activities of the designated ANDI Centre of Excellence for Malaria Diagnosis by the African Network for Drugs and Diagnostic Initiative (ANDI)  a World Health Organization (WHO)-supported platform to drive health innovation in Africa. The ANDI Centre of Excellence was among the 42 Centre of Excellence established in Africa in 2011: HYPERLINK "http://www.andi-africa.org/images/stories/4thmtg/4th-ANDI-Meeting-ClosingPressRelease.pdf"http://www.andi-africa.org/images/stories/4thmtg/4th-ANDI-Meeting-ClosingPressRelease.pdf. On 27th November, 2017, WHO again designated the ANDI Centre of Excellence for Malaria Diagnosis as the Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test Lot Verification facility along side NIMR, India: HYPERLINK "http://www.who.int/malaria/news/2017/rdt-lot-testing/en/"http://www.who.int/malaria/news/2017/rdt-lot-testing/en/. 
                    Over the years, this Centre has built capacity of healthcare providers at different levels around the country and conducted research impacting practice, product quality and policy. With a network of collaborators around the world, the Centre is positioned to mount postgraduate courses in tropical health sciences to build critical mass of scientists and also to strengthen the capacity of healthcare providers and programme staff in the various diseases areas. The research and capacity development injected to the Centre has been mainly achieved through national and international collaborations and this will be accentuated in the years to come given the critical role of strategic partnerships cost-effectiveness and sustainability of programmes. The interconnectivity between the environment, communicable diseases, social and cultural rubrics, and the convergence thereof with malaria and the NTDs makes the configuration of our programmes to be holistic and competitive as these align to the attainment of the Social Development Goals (SDGs) in which institutions should be critical players. This is the basis of our goal as outlined below. Members of the Centre are drawn from basic, clinical, environmental, social sciences; mathematics, Computer Sciences, and the humanities.

                    PREMISE: Neurological disorders are currently the leading source of death and disability globally according to current Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) Study estimates. The bulk of the burden is contributed by neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) and Stroke. The situation is so dire that an emergent NDD and stroke global pandemic has been identified and annotated as requiring urgentintervention, including increased focus on implementation of preventive, therapeutic, andrestorative strategies. On this basis, the Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition (DCP-2) 2006identified top priority neurological conditions that includes such conditions as Alzheimers disease and otherdementias, Parkinson disease, and Stroke. Approximately 3 million persons in sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to suffer from NDDs(predominantly Alzheimers dementia, Parkinson disease and Motor Neuron disease). Dementiaaffects nearly 2.1 million persons in subSaharan Africa, and the associated mortality is triple that in North America. Stroke is the single most important neurological disorder in Nigeria, and the leading non-communicable disease emergency. Current global estimates of the burden of stroke indicate that there are 16 million first-ever strokes, 62 million stroke survivors, 51 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs), and 5.7 million deaths from stroke annually. These figures are expected to increase astronomically by 2030 to 23 million, 77 million, 61 million, and 7.8 million in the absence of effective interventions aimed at reducing the burden. This is of particular importance in developing countries in Africa, including Nigeria, where westernization has impacted on lifestyle risk factor profile of the population and increased the burden of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Furthermore, rudimentaryprimordial, primary and secondary preventive strategies, competing communicable diseasechallenges, and the enormous financial conundrum culminate in complicating the burden ofstroke. The estimated annual mortality rate of stroke in Nigeria is 120  240 per 100,000population. Stroke is associated with significant disability in survivors, with the burden reportedas 881  1040 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to stroke in Nigeria every year.Research interventions aimed at understanding the drivers of prevalence, incidence and outcomesin epilepsy, NDDs and stroke are imperative as these will propel the development of targeted,contextually relevant primordial, primary and secondary preventive and therapeutic strategies todrive down disease burden. CENSRT will be a multidisciplinary center fostering research and capacity building focusedon the neurological sciences with a primary focus on contextual relevance to Nigeria. The opportunities for research cutacross basic and clinical neurosciences, epidemiology, genetics, humanities, sociology, law, biological sciences, and translational research related to the core focus of CENSRT. The Centre will use a collaborative trans-institutional, national, continental and global network of collaboration and partnership to achieve its aims and objectives.

                    Vision:     To develop transferable and employable skills in production and regulation of herbal medicines and drug
                    Mission: To build up manpower on quality assurance, standardization of dosages, reproducibility of herbal preparations, drug development, drug repurposing and safety monitoring of drugs in West and Central African region.
                    Philosophy:
                    Africa is blessed with a rich biodiversity and a people with knowledge of how to use plants as medicines.  However, the challenges regarding herbal medicines are centered around standardization, safety, adulteration and irrational use.  This is largely due to a dearth of skilled manpower in their production and regulation.  Through training of mid-career professionals and scientific research, ACEDHARS is developing producers and regulators of herbal medicines and drugs for effective healthcare delivery in Africa and the world at large.
                    Outline of Achievements
                    With the advent of COVID-19 Pandemic virus, the center was able to run five short courses namely certificate in formulation and packaging of herbal medicine and products, standardization and quality control of Herbal products, Pharmacovigilance and Regulatory science, virtually in 2020, 2021 and 2022 with great participation from the West African sub-region.
                    The Inaugural Symposium and Launching of the Centertook place on Wednesday, 26th January, 2022 with the theme: Drug Development from African Medicinal Plants: Opportunities, Challenges and Regulatory Approach.

                    Year of Establishment:
                    2020

                    Where Domicile/Location:

                    Dr. James Akanmu


                    The University of Lagos Sustainable Procurement, Environmental and Social Standards Centre of Excellence (SPESSCE) was established in 2020 as an initiative of the World Bank and the Federal Government of Nigeria through the National Universities Commission (NUC). The Center is one of six Centres of Excellence approved by the World Bank and NUC after competitive bidding by Federal Universities in Nigeri


                    Vision
                    To attain national and continental leadership in human capital development, cutting edge research, policy development, implementation in sustainable Procurement, Environmental and Social Standards (PES) and to catalyse the attainment of the sustainable development goals (SDGs

                    Mission
                    To build capacities in public and private procurement, environmental and social standards especially as it pertains to Procurement Planning, Regulations and Sustainable Procurement set by the International Community and National legislation. 




                    Projection and Goal 

                    Procurement professionals, environmental and social development specialists, and compliance professionals are generally few in Nigeria (and the West-Central Africa region in general).  This is due to a lack of academic programmes/curricula tailored specifically to addressing the interdisciplinary nature of public procurement, as well as environmental and social safeguards. Also, there is a significant number of people in the finance/business, environment, natural resource and social sectors who are discipline-trained and discipline-focused but lacking in inter-disciplinary orientation. Hence, there is an urgent need to build skills and expertise through training.

                    THE INSTITUTE OF MARITIME STUDIES
                    Year Established: 2013
                    Location: Behind Akintunde Ojo Building
                    Current Director: Prof. M.O. Ilori.
                    The Institute of Maritime Studies (IMS), University of Lagos, is one of the degrees awarding maritime institutions in Nigeria and was established in conjunction with the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in 2013. Currently, IMS runs six postgraduate degrees comprising of three Professional Masters and three Postgraduate Diploma programmes as listed hereunder:
                    Master of Maritime Administration and Management;
                    Master of Hydrographic Surveying;
                    Master of Logistic and Supply Chain Management;
                    Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Communication & Navigation;
                    Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Environmental Studies;
                    Postgraduate Diploma in Maritime Administration and Management.
                    The maritime industry is key to the proper operation of the Nigerian economy since bulk goods are exported and imported mainly through the sea ports. It is a major source of revenue for the government, probably the second largest after the oil industry. The maritime industry is also a major partner of the oil industry as export and import of crude and refined oil and other essential goods take place through the ports. 
                    The University of Lagos, situated by the Lagos lagoon, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean, is naturally endowed with the needed environment that is required to properly train students in maritime programmes. The city of Lagos is the economic nerve centre of Nigeria and it is strategically the hub of maritime businesses in Nigeria. The University of Lagos is also tactically located to major maritime players like NIMASA, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Apapa Bulk Terminals Limited (ABTL), African Circle Pollution Management Limited (ACPML), Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), Nigerian Institute of Oceanography and Marine Research (NIOMR) and Federal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology (FCFMT). 
                    Maritime education in Nigeria is developing, it is gradually responding to the huge needs of the industry. Existing gaps, especially those of facilities for sea time and some hard-core specific technologies, are being responded to, at the University of Lagos through credible partnership with many of the stakeholders in the private sector and reputable international institutions.  Eliminating any gap is very important to the University because which is known for excellence in all chosen areas of interest. 
                    IMS has an array of well trained and dedicated lecturers drawn internally from our faculties of Engineering, Law, Management Sciences, Pharmacy, Science, Social Sciences, Environmental Sciences and Medicine. Lecturers who are practitioners have also been drawn from the professional institutions which include NIMASA, NPA, ABTL, ACPML, Council for the Regulation of Freight Forwarding in Nigeria (CRFFN) and the Nigerian Association of Master Mariners amongst others. The Institute has key critical training facilities which include Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Bridge Simulators. IMS is strongly determined to contribute more towards the capacity development of the Nigerian maritime industry, we will remain focused, by turning challenges to opportunities

                    The Centre was established to train Low vision rehabilitation practitioners, as well as conduct cutting-edge research with a focus on tackling the growing burden of blindness and scarcity of rehabilitation services for blind persons. There is currently no training institution or research Centre for Low Vision professionals in the entire West African region.  There is marked scarcity of Low Vision services providers and the lack of opportunities to train professionals in the field currently exacerbates the challenges of access to low vision services for individuals living with blindness and Low Vision. There is also dearth of cutting-edge research in the area of Low vision as well as a remarkably inadequate access to Low vision devices and assistive technologies enabling individuals with Low vision to live meaningful lives unaided. The poor access to Low vision rehabilitation services, devices, technologies for independent living has made lives of many visually impaired persons unbearably frustrating as they practically depend on sighted family members and friends to perform simple tasks of daily living. The proposed Centre intends to build capacity and develop a critical mass of Low vision experts that will respond to the growing needs for Low vision Services, cutting-edge research in the field of Low vision, as well as improve access to Low vision services and local availability of assistive technologies through strong partnerships in continuing (postgraduate) education and research. The approach is built on a multi-disciplinary platform involving experts in the fields of Ophthalmology, Optometry, allied ,Medical Sciences, Public Health, Sociology, and Engineering. To bridge the professional capacity gap, the Centre will run the following programmes in collaboration with the Western Michigan University, USA: 1. Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip) in:
                    i. Vision Rehabilitation Therapy, ii. Orientation and Mobility, and iii. Low vision rehabilitation & counselling. 2. Master of Science (MSc) in: i. Vision Rehabilitation Therapy, (ii) Orientation and Mobility, and (iii) Low vision rehabilitation & counselling. It will also serve as a research center in low vision rehabilitation  this is first of its kind in the entire West African region! 



                    Vision: 
                    The vision of the proposed Centre will be to provide a platform for quality training and research in Low Vision care, as well as inform policy and practice for the adoption of international best practices in Low Vision training and service delivery.

                    Mission:
                    The mission of the Centre is to improve the quality of life of individuals with low vision through provision of excellent low vision rehabilitation services by competently trained vision rehabilitation specialists and cutting-edge research.

                    Outline of Achievements

                    MoU has been signed with Western Michigan University (WMU), USA for Partnership in Research and Postgraduate Training. The WMU program in these fields is one of only 4 accredited Low vision rehabilitation programs in the United States, and is the largest and oldest program
                    Several physical visits to Western Michigan University, USA (By Prof. Akinsola Folasade and Dr. Patrick Okonji) to discuss with WMU faculty on co-development of the curriculum and co-delivering the postgraduate programs.
                    Curricular for PgDip and MSc. In Orientation and Mobility (O&M) and Vision Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT) has been developed (as well as detailed specifications of program entry requirements) have been submitted to the School of Postgraduate Studies for approval before planned commencement of the programs next year (soon after approval is granted)
                    WMU faculty members (including Prof. James Leja  former HOD of the Department of Blindness and Low Vision Studies, WMU, and Dr. Elyse Connors  Associate Professor at Department of Blindness and Low Vision Studies, WMU, are waiting for approval and commencement of the Program, to enable them visit the WARTCLOR in September 2022, for 6months to teach some academic programs)
                    WMU faculty is currently working with WARTCLOR to explore international funding opportunities for the Centre
                    Informal talks have started with Northeastern University, Boston, USA for MoUs, staff and student exchanges, and research collaboration with WARTCLOR 

                    *Future Projection/Goal and other Information

                    Attract significant local and international funding opportunities for cutting-edge research at the Centre
                    Commence PGDip and MSC programs in O&M and VRT Postgraduate Programs
                    Train not less than 50 Low vision rehabilitation practitioners in the first year
                    Engage in student and staff exchanges with Western Michigan University and Northeastern University
                    Collaborate with the Riyal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB), United Kingdom
                    Have a funded physical building that will provide an atmosphere for learning that is both safe and expectant. Safe in the sense that the students are secure knowing that they will be respected, valued and appreciated. Expectant, in the sense that they will be challenged to think deeply, to better understand themselves, and to assimilate new knowledge and ideas
                    Conduct funded research on improving access to low vision rehabilitation services in limited-resource settings, developing novel adaptive orientation and mobility techniques for visually impaired person in Nigeria and pedagogical approaches for modern and balanced teaching of vision rehabilitation programs in Nigeria/Sub Sahara Africa.
