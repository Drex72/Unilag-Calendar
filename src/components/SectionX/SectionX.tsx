                <div>
                    <p>
                        The Management of the University considered the period within newly employed female pregnant staff are expected to accept the offer of employment given to them as well as take into consideration the fact that all offers of appointment are subject to the production of evidence of good health and such staff are expected to obtain a medical certificate of fitness from the Director of Medical Services.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In carrying out these laboratory tests, pregnant women cannot undergo the mandatory screening exercises due to their peculiar conditions and as a result the three (3) months duration given to other staff may not be applicable to them.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>In recent times, there has been series of requests from newly recruited female staff or maternity leave within three (3) to five (5) months of assumption of duties. It is pertinent to note that the Public Service Rules and the University Conditions of Service made no provision for situations like this. It is therefore apparent that, there is need for a clear policy on the procedure to be adopted for newly employed pregnant women bearing in mind the need to avoid discrimination due to their peculiar condition.
                        In view of the above, it is hereby proposed as follows:
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>1. Aims of the Policy</strong></p>
                    <p>The aims of this policy is to ensure that</p>
                    <p>(a) The university's Employment policy accommodates pregnant women;</p>
                    <p>(b) The University is sensitive to the plight of pregnant women;</p>
                    <p>(c) Not much work-hour are lost in the discharge of duties due to such conditions.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p><strong>2. Details of the Policy</strong></p>
                    <p>(a) Newly employed pregnant women should be allowed to accept the offer of employment before the expiration of three (3) months granted for newly employed staff with the option to defer assumption of duty until after delivery;</p>
                    <p>(b) If by the expiration of a six months period after the initial three month period for acceptance the staff is unable to assume duties and undergo the medical screening, the offer should lapse.</p>
                    <p>(c) Where a newly employed staff become pregnant after resumption of duty, and desires to proceed on maternity leave before spending up to one year on the job, the period she worked will be pro-rated and she will be paid for that period only while the remaining days will be without pay.</p>
                    <p>(d) Any woman who is pregnant at the time of job interview and job offer is under a duty to disclose not only the fact of pregnancy but also the stage of pregnancy to enable University decide, bearing in the stage of pregnancy whether the woman is qualified for medical screening.</p>
                    <p>(e) Where a pregnant woman fails to disclose the fact of pregnancy or misrepresents the stage of pregnancy to the university and thereafter  undergoes medical screening, the university shall be absolved and liability for any damage which the medical screening may cause to the foetus.</p>

                <p>To build up capacity amongst non-teaching members of staff, it is desired to encourage staff to pursue various training programs that could be of short, medium and long term duration. Annually, a large number of staff embark on self-development programmes and ultimately express the desire to have their effort rewarded by the university up completion. In order to streamline this, the following is being proposed:</p>

                <p>ii. Heads of Departments/Units shall have the opportunity to ensure that members of their staff are given the necessary opportunity to undertake appropriate training, by identifying the training needs (i.e., the additional skill, knowledge and attitude) required to effectively perform their duties. Such identified training needs should be communicated to the staff training and development unit immediately after the compilation of their performance appraisal reports.</p>
                <p>iii. It is mandatory for any officer that has been sponsored to submit a study/training report and certificate of participation (where applicable) to the Human Resources Management Department within one week of completion of the programme.</p>
                <p>iv. Where possible, the ST&DU should reproduce the training in-house in order to share the knowledge/skill gained with relevant staff/units in the university.</p>
                <p>v. Heads of Departments/units should ensure equity and fairness/fair play in the nomination of staff for training and as much as possible ensure every staff in the Department/Unit is nominated for training over a period of time.</p>
                <p>vi. In case a staff has not gone for training for a while, the Head of Department/Unit should provide information to the staff training and development unit on why the staff has no had such opportunity.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>STUDY LEAVE</strong></p>
                <p>In order to build up capacity amongst members of staff, it is desirable to encourage staff to pursue various training programs that could be of short, medium and long term duration. To be considered for any of these leaves, an applicant must satisfy the following conditions:</p>

                <p>4. Staff may decide to embark on self-development efforts provided that such programmes would have no effect on the performance of their scheduled duty.</p>

                <p>i. The course of training must be relevant to the job schedule of the staff.</p>
                <p>ii. As with medium term training, only a member of staff whose employment has been confirmed should be eligible for sponsorship</p>
                <p>iii. he approval for a candidate to pursue such programme should be based on the ability of the department/unit to cover the schedule without need for a replacement.</p>

                <p>v. For staff undertaking programmes requiring one/two day release, prior approval must be obtained to enable them pursue the pogramme on such time basis.</p>
                <p>vi. Staff on study leave are not eligible for annual leave in accordance with extant rule.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Personal/Self Development Effort</strong></p>
                <p>i. Staff embarking on long term self-development study programmes such as the Open University Programmes or the Distance Learning Institute course must obtain prior approval of their Head of Department or Unit before commencement.</p>
                <p>ii. The period of residential training must coincide with the annual leave period of the individual concerned.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
                <p>It is expected that with these guidelines, the university will be able to have a wider coverage and equity in its staff development effort which should lead to a more dynamic and virile workforce well equipped to deliver on their schedules.</p>
                <br />
                <p>These guidelines should be reviewed every five years to make it responsive to the needs of the university community and curb abuses. Management is hereby invited to consider this proposal and recommend for further consideration as necessary.</p>
